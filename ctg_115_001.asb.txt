Alright, I'm done taking care of the animals for the day,[nl]time to head home!
RAK/RAK0070170
....But then again, I haven't seen Chitoge since[nl]she had to run to the bathroom earlier....
RAK/RAK0070180
Hello?
CTG/CTG0018410
Sorry, Raku! I had to run ahead home!
RAK/RAK0070190
Huh? How come?
RAK/RAK0070200
....Well, I've finished cleaning anyway.[nl]Alright, have a good night.
CTG/CTG0018420
Really? Oh, I was in a hurry to leave, and I accidentally[nl]left my homework printouts in the classroom.[nl]Sorry, but could you bring them to me?
RAK/RAK0070210
Huh!? Why do I have to....[nl]You should be able to do at least that much for yourself.
CTG/CTG0018430
I-I already told you, I was in a hurry![nl]I don't have time to go back to the classroom.
CTG/CTG0018440
....So please help me![nl]Don't say anything, just bring them to my house! Alright!?
RAK/RAK0070220
Don't say anything, she says....[nl]What a pain....
RAK/RAK0070230
Nothing I can do. Better bring them to her.

CTG/CTG0018450
O-Oh, it's Raku.
RAK/RAK0070240
Whaddya mean "Oh, it's Raku"!?[nl]Here, your printouts!
RAK/RAK0070250
....Jeez, stop treating me like your errand boy so much.
CTG/CTG0018460
S-Sorry, sorry. Don't get so mad at me.
@expose
CTG/CTG0018470
But I couldn't really think of a better pretext....
RAK/RAK0070260
Huh? Pretext?
CTG/CTG0018480
A-Ahem.
CTG/CTG0018490
Uhhh, Raku, this isn't exactly a thank-you for bringing[nl]me the printouts, b-but if you want, you can have this.
RAK/RAK0070270
T-This is....!
RAK/RAK0070280
This is that limited-edition top quality dorayaki[nl]from that very-long established Japanese[nl]confectionery brand "Kuronuma"!
RAK/RAK0070290
C-Cool! I'd heard rumors about this, but I'd figured[nl]it'd be too expensive to afford on my budget....!
CTG/CTG0018500
Umm....just a few minutes ago, we had a visitor,[nl]and he "coincidentally" "by chance" had this as a[nl]souvenir for me, y'know?
CTG/CTG0018510
I-It was around then that I "just so happened"[nl]to remember that you like dorayaki.
CTG/CTG0018520
So I figured I "might as well" give this to you "for now"....
CTG/CTG0018530
It's not like I bought this for you or anything,[nl]but, um, if you wanna think of it as a thank-you for bringing[nl]me these printouts....
RAK/RAK0070300
(The timeline there feels weird,[nl] and a lot of it sounds rushed, but, well....)
RAK/RAK0070310
Thank you, Chitoge![nl]I'd always wanted to try these, I'm so glad!
CTG/CTG0018540
R-Really? Well, that's good!
RAK/RAK0070320
Yeah. You know how much I love this stuff.
CTG/CTG0018550
Well....that's because you recommended it to me earlier.
RAK/RAK0070330
Huh? I did....?
RAK/RAK0070340
Umm.....
When was this?
Our first date
RAK/RAK0070350
Sorry, I don't remember when this was....
CTG/CTG0018560
Y-You don't remember!?
CTG/CTG0018570
Hahhh.... Well, whatever....[nl]I guess that's that.
RAK/RAK0070360
S-Sorry....
RAK/RAK0070370
(Did I say anything like that....)
RAK/RAK0070380
That's right, that did happen at one point.[nl]That was the day we had our first date, right?
@ザクシャ千棘・中
@expose
CTG/CTG0018580
At least you remember.
RAK/RAK0070390
Yeah. I gave you a dorayaki to apologize for all the trouble[nl]I caused you, and you told me you didn't like it.
CTG/CTG0018590
W-Well sure, because I really didn't like it.
CTG/CTG0018600
But now....since you say it's so good,[nl]maybe I'd....like to try a little.
RAK/RAK0070400
Oh, really? Well, let's split it, then.
CTG/CTG0018610
Okay, thanks.
