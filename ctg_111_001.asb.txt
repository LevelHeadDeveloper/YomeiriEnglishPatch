I wonder what real lovers do after school.[nl]I read about them in magazines, but I can't seem to[nl]find anything about it.
RAK/RAK0069410
I mean, like, do you *want* to do what real lovers do?[nl]What specifically?
CTG/CTG0017620
Me? No, I don't really....

Huh? Why?
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0017670
C-Come on.[nl]It's not that unusual for lovers to be holding hands.
CTG/CTG0017680
Besides, it's possible that Claude or someone[nl]is watching us, right?
RAK/RAK0069470
Oh....I see.[nl]I forgot for a second there that we never know[nl]when we're being watched.
CTG/CTG0017690
Right? Y-You should really be more careful.
RAK/RAK0069480
Understood. Okay, let's get going.
CTG/CTG0017700
