Maaan, I'm staaaarved.[nl]I'm about to go to club, but I can barely staaand.
MSB/MSB0000280
Alright, you can have this omusubi. I bought some at the[nl]cafeteria earlier, but I had some left over.
MSA/MSA0000350
Oh, bonito onigiri. Thanks a bunch!

Chitoge, how come you're looking at me like that?[nl]Are you hungry again?
CTG/CTG0018660
Incorrect.
@expose
CTG/CTG0018670
....I mean, why do you always assume[nl]it's just because I'm hungry?
RAK/RAK0070500
Because I'm usually right, right?
CTG/CTG0018680
You're wrong more often than you're right![nl]There's something skewed about your perception!
RAK/RAK0070510
Alright, what were you thinking?
CTG/CTG0018690
Wasn't there something weird about their[nl]conversation just now?
RAK/RAK0070520
What?
CTG/CTG0018700
Onigiri and omusubi. They were talking[nl]about the same thing, but they used different words.
RAK/RAK0070530
Did they? You certainly listened carefully.
CTG/CTG0018710
Well, sure.[nl]....So, what's the difference between onigiri and omusubi?
RAK/RAK0070540
The difference, huh....[nl]I think they mean the same thing.[nl]I mean, I've never really thought too hard about it before.
CTG/CTG0018720
Hmmm, I see.[nl]Japanese does have some other words like that.
CTG/CTG0018730
Like "ohagi" and "botamochi"....[nl]They're the same thing, right?
RAK/RAK0070590
If you don't know something, it's best to look it up.
CTG/CTG0018770
Aaah, is that a dictionary!?[nl]Have you been carrying that around with you!?
RAK/RAK0070600
As it happens. Let's see.....ohagi and botamochi.... Ah.
RAK/RAK0070610
"Botamochi is made during the spring,[nl] while ohagi is made during the fall."
CTG/CTG0018780
Really?
RAK/RAK0070620
They're made to look like peonies in the spring,[nl]and bush clover in the fall. But that's just one theory,[nl]and there's a lot of different theories on this.
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0018790
Hmmmm. Japanese is sure profound.
CTG/CTG0018800
It would be interesting to check this kind of thing out.[nl]We should go do that sometime, Raku.
RAK/RAK0070630
Yeah, sure.
RAK/RAK0070550
I think the name of it changes depending on where it's[nl]made and what time of year it is. I'm not quite sure of[nl]the details, though.
RAK/RAK0070560
You sure seem to have a lot on your mind.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0018740
Hehe, well, I am a returnee, after all.[nl]I'm very aware of language!
RAK/RAK0070570
Crude, though.
CTG/CTG0018750
....Did you say something?
RAK/RAK0070580
No.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0018760
But honestly, Japanese is so weird....
