Hey, Chitoge! You alright!?
CTG/CTG0019090

RAK/RAK0070840
You took quite the fall just now!
CTG/CTG0019100
O-Oh no. Did you see that....?
RAK/RAK0070850
Yeah! That doesn't matter, just answer me![nl]Did you hit your head or anything?
@expose
CTG/CTG0019110
I-I didn't hit my head....[nl]I just fell on my butt....
RAK/RAK0070860
I see.... That's a relief.
CTG/CTG0019120
By any chance....were you worried about me?
Of course I am!
O-Of course not!
RAK/RAK0070870
Of course I am!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0019130
Ah....
RAK/RAK0070880
Jeez, dude....[nl]Try not to fall down outta nowhere anymore.
CTG/CTG0019140
S-Sorry....
CTG/CTG0019150
But I didn't just fall down out of nowhere.[nl]I stepped on something and I fe--
RAK/RAK0070890
I-I wasn't particularly worried about you....
CTG/CTG0019160
Hmmm, I see.
RAK/RAK0070900
....But even so, you should try not to fall down[nl]outta nowhere like that. It could startle you.
CTG/CTG0019170
Rude. I didn't just fall down out of nowhere.[nl]I stepped on something and I fell--
@ＢＧＭ停止
CTG/CTG0019180
do....wn....
RAK/RAK0070910
Don't tell me....[nl]Did you slip on a banana peel....?
CTG/CTG0019190
----!
RAK/RAK0070920
T-That's so cliche....[nl]Pfft. Hehe....
CTG/CTG0019200
H-Hey, you! Forget everything you've seen here![nl]Or I'll hit you so hard I'll erase them myself!
RAK/RAK0070930
H-Hey, calm down![nl]There's no way I can just up and forget!
@expose2
CTG/CTG0019210
Uugh, this sucks![nl]I haven't been even a little bit lucky since this morning?
RAK/RAK0070940
....I see. How exactly have you been unlucky?
CTG/CTG0019220
You won't laugh?
RAK/RAK0070950
Yeah, I won't.
RAK/RAK0070960
(....Maybe.)
CTG/CTG0019230
A-Alright....
CTG/CTG0019240
First of all, I woke up this morning and....[nl]T-There was a brown thing in my room!
RAK/RAK0070970
A brown thing? What was it?
CTG/CTG0019250
A-A bug....[nl]Nghh, I don't even wanna say its name,[nl]but it's that nine-letter one that starts with C!
RAK/RAK0070980
Oh, a cockroach.[nl]I didn't take you for the type to have trouble with bugs.
CTG/CTG0019260
Don't say its name, I'll remember it!
CTG/CTG0019270
A-Anyway....I screamed, and Claude and the others[nl]immediately rushed in and killed it....but in the process,[nl]the lunch I had made ended up spilled all over the floor.
RAK/RAK0070990
Oh....sounds like a disaster....
CTG/CTG0019280
After that, all kinds of little mishaps happened.
CTG/CTG0019290
I brought the wrong textbooks by mistake,[nl]and when I looked in my wallet, it was empty....
RAK/RAK0071000
(Those two can be chalked up to your mistakes[nl] more than simple misfortune....)
CTG/CTG0019300
And to top it all off, that banana peel just now.[nl]Aah, today's seriously not my lucky day!
RAK/RAK0071010
Hahh.... Good grief.
RAK/RAK0071020
....Here, you can have this.
CTG/CTG0019310
....Huh?[nl]That came outta nowhere.
RAK/RAK0071030
Well, I mean....[nl]It's nice to have at least *something* good happen, right?
CTG/CTG0019320
I-It's not so simple that I can feel good about[nl]something like this.
RAK/RAK0071040
Oh, I see....[nl]Sorry about that.
CTG/CTG0019330
....Kidding.
RAK/RAK0071050
Huh?
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0019340
This is a good thing.[nl].....Just a little bit.
RAK/RAK0071060
Well, I wouldn't worry too much about it.[nl]Some days are just like that.
CTG/CTG0019350
Ngh, you don't sound like you care.....[nl]Well, that can't really be helped, can it....
