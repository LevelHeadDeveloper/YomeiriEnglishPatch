I'm glad you understand.
RUR/RUR0007400
I don't have a problem with this glasses-world continuing[nl]to exist as it does. So there's no need to be embarrassed[nl]to put your glasses back on.

RAK/RAK0033920
I see, is that so....?
@expose
RUR/RUR0007410
We'll be fine. We're all wearing glasses,[nl]so our days will be the same as yesterday.
SYU/SYU0005910
Really, listening to you, Ruri,[nl]I feel like it doesn't matter either way!
SYU/SYU0005920
I know girls with glasses are the norm now,[nl]but if you really think about it, there's more room for the[nl]"girls with no glasses" genre, right?
RAK/RAK0033930
G-Girls with no glasses....I guess there is now.[nl]But wouldn't that just make you a regular pervert in this world?
RUR/RUR0007420
Right, right. As long as you understand those values,[nl]you'll get used to this world, Ichijo.[nl]Don't worry too much, you'll be fine.
RAK/RAK0033940
Yeah, you're right....[nl]It feels strange right now....[nl]But maybe it is just a matter of getting used to it.
RAK/RAK0033950
So maybe you're right, Miyamoto.[nl]We don't need to force things back to how they were.
RUR/RUR0007430
I'm glad you made the safe choice.[nl]Thank you, Ichijo and Maiko.
SYU/SYU0005930
Hey, hey, don't worry about it.[nl]We're glasses buddies, after all.
RUR/RUR0007440
It's kind of emotional to think about how[nl]that phrase won't apply after this time.
RAK/RAK0033960
I guess so.[nl]After all, everyone else is wearing glasses too, right?
RUR/RUR0007460
Ichijo, don't forget to wear your glasses tomorrow.
RAK/RAK0033970
Yeah, I know.[nl]Glasses or get caught!
RAK/RAK0033520G
Hahahahahahahaha!

(In the end, we decided not to take off[nl] our glasses that day and let the glasses-world[nl] continue to exist....)
RAK/RAK0033990
(Everyone wears glasses, wherever we look.[nl] Politicians and celebrities on TV, dogs[nl] and cats on the streets, everyone.)
RAK/RAK0034000
(At first, it was confusing to see[nl] everyone wearing glasses all the time....)
RAK/RAK0034010
(But like Miyamoto said,[nl] once I got used to it, it didn't[nl] seem like a big deal....)
RAK/RAK0034020
(Humans have a terrifying capacity for adaptation,[nl] so once they get used to something,[nl] it doesn't seem like a big deal....)

It's starting to feel less and less out of place[nl]that everyone in our class is wearing glasses....
KSK/KSK0008520
Huh? Ichijo, what did you say?
RAK/RAK0034040
Uh, nothing. It wasn't important....
........
KSK/KSK0008530
Um, w-what's the matter?[nl]You're staring at my face....
RAK/RAK0034050
I was wondering....[nl]Onodera, do you ever take off your glasses?
@expose
KSK/KSK0008540
Aaaaaaah!?[nl]I-I can't do that in public!
KSK/KSK0008550
Oh, but Ichijo, what happened[nl]to that thing you told me about fixing the broken world?
RAK/RAK0034060
S-Sorry, Onodera. You can just.....forget I said anything.[nl]That was just a little misunderstanding.
KSK/KSK0008560
O-Oh, yeah. I thought so.[nl]Haha....hahaha.....
RAK/RAK0034070
O-Oh, yeah.[nl]I'm sorry if I asked you something weird.....
KSK/KSK0008570
N-No. It's okay, but....
KSK/KSK0008580
I-I have to go to my next class for my elective.[nl]Next is History of Glasses!
RUR/RUR0007470
Do you still have any regrets?[nl]About not returning to the original world?
RAK/RAK0034080
No, not really. I just miss Onodera's old face.
RUR/RUR0007480
Hmmm....
RAK/RAK0034090
Well, I've gotten so used to this world's new ettiquete[nl]that I feel uneasy if I ever take off my glasses.[nl]It feels like I'm finally getting the hang of things.
RUR/RUR0007490
Hey, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0034100
What is it?
RUR/RUR0007500
If you miss people's real faces so much,[nl]how about I take off my glasses for you?[nl]Consider it a one-time favor.
RAK/RAK0034110
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0034120
Y-You're joking, aren't you, Miyamoto.
RUR/RUR0007510
Yes. Of course I'm joking.[nl]I'd never do something so outrageous.
RAK/RAK0034130
T-That's true....[nl]You really had me there.
RUR/RUR0007520
Well, one day you won't miss people's real faces.[nl]Until then, have a little patience.
RAK/RAK0034140
Yeah....
RAK/RAK0034150
Well, whatever the case, thanks, Miyamoto.[nl]I'm glad there's people like you and Shuu[nl]who understand the situation.
RUR/RUR0007530
Likewise. Let's do our best until we get used to this.
RUR/RUR0007540
Okay, Ichijo?
