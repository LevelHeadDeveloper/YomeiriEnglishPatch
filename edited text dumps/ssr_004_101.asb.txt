Well, I guess that's true, but....[nl]Are you really satisfied with that?
SSR/SSR0004690
I've done something horrible to you.[nl]That's....the undeniable truth.

Master Claude also goes off the rails[nl]whenever the Mistress is involved.
SSR/SSR0004720
Although I do have the deepest[nl]respect for Master Claude....
SSR/SSR0004730
I see.... I guess that's how[nl]I come across to people around me....

Well, whatever the case....
