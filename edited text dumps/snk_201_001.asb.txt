....No sign of Maiko anywhere.
RAK/RAK0031470
Maybe he went somewhere else by mistake?
KSK/KSK0008230
Oh, Ruri and Ichijo![nl]Did you guys come to buy photo books?
RUR/RUR0005210
Kosaki....[nl]You have a photo book?
KSK/KSK0008240
Maiko was selling photo books here a while ago.[nl]I got a special copy from him! â™ª[nl]Here! 
RAK/RAK0031480
Onodera....[nl]Did you see what's in it?
KSK/KSK0008250
Nope. I haven't looked.
KSK/KSK0008260
But Maiko said "it's very soothing!", so I'm[nl]guessing it's a collection of landscapes or something....
RUR/RUR0005220
....I strongly advise against looking inside.
KSK/KSK0008270
Huh, really? What's in there?
RAK/RAK0031490
It's okay, Onodera![nl]You don't have to look!
RUR/RUR0005230
....If we don't catch Maiko soon,[nl]it looks like there will be even more victims.
RAK/RAK0031500
Maybe he's doing this between schools.[nl]Jeez, a regular caravan.
RUR/RUR0005240
Hey, Kosaki, any idea where Maiko's headed next?
KSK/KSK0008280
Uh, yeah. Let's see....[nl]He said something about doing the next one[nl]in the home-ec room....
RUR/RUR0005250
Got it. Thanks, Kosaki.[nl]I'll make sure to avenge you.
RUR/RUR0005260
....Well, let's go, Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0031510
R-Right. See you, Onodera.
KSK/KSK0008290
Y-Yeah. I don't know what you're doing,[nl]but good luck.
