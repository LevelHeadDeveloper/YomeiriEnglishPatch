How on earth would photos of me[nl]help the swim team?
How would this help?
School newspaper
Club recruitment
School festival pamphlet
Cover of a photo book
RUR/RUR0002570
An article in the school newspaper, you say?
RUR/RUR0002580
That would certainly raise[nl]the club's profile, but....
RUR/RUR0002600
How can you be involved in the school newspaper[nl]if you're not a member of the newspaper club?
RUR/RUR0002610
Don't lie to me.[nl]Most likely, you're getting orders from Maiko.
@rur_003_201
RUR/RUR0002620
We can use them to recruit members[nl]for the swim team, huh?
RUR/RUR0002630
I mean, while we are a small club and[nl]I wouldn't mind more members....
@ザクシャるり・１
RUR/RUR0002640
I'm surprised you'd go out of your way to[nl]make a suggestion like that, Ichijo.

RUR/RUR0002650
The school festival....[nl]That was wrapped up just the other day.
RUR/RUR0002660
Huh? Selling swimsuit photos[nl]in the school underground for profit?
RUR/RUR0002670
Ichijo, you're talking the same nonsense as Maiko!
RUR/RUR0002680
.....Or maybe that's the truth.[nl]Was this all Maiko's suggestion!?
RUR/RUR0002690
It's fine. You don't need to think so hard.
RUR/RUR0002700
I know Maiko put you up to this, anyway.
RUR/RUR0002710
Jeez. He hasn't learned his lesson[nl]after all that punishment....
