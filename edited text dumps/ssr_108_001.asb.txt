Hahh....why has the Mistress left me behind again?
RAK/RAK0053970
What, did something happen with Chitoge?
SSR/SSR0013320
She said she was going to go grab some drinks[nl]with Ms. Onodera and the others. I offered to run to the store[nl]and pick some up for her....but she refused.
SSR/SSR0013330
And then she said:[nl]"I don't need you to escort me, so just be quiet!"[nl]....and refused to let me accompany her.
@expose
SSR/SSR0013340
Aaagh.... What'll I do if something terrible[nl]happens to her while we're apart!?
RAK/RAK0053980
I doubt something that serious would happen here at school.
SSR/SSR0013350
Preposterous! She's the daughter of the leader of the[nl]Beehive! I wouldn't be surprised if someone dangerous[nl]infiltrated the school with their sights set on the Mistress!
RAK/RAK0053990
(To be honest, *you're* the most dangerous person in the school....[nl] I don't think I'll bring that up, though.)
SSR/SSR0013360
Even at this very moment, there may be people[nl]in this school who could hold a gun at her any chance they get!
RAK/RAK0054000
I doubt there's anyone like that in--

Ngh, hey, get off me, Tsugumi!
SSR/SSR0013390
Don't raise your head! You'll get shot!
SSR/SSR0013400
Two shots fired from the same direction....[nl]They're close!
RAK/RAK0054030
(H-Her chest is right in front of me....)
MRK/MRK0010710
Kyaaaah! Tsugumi! What have you been up to[nl]while I was away at the infirmaryyyy!?
SSR/SSR0013410
What the hell are you doing!? Get down, quick![nl]You'll die if you keep standing there!
MRK/MRK0010720

RAK/RAK0054040

SSR/SSR0013450

WSA/WSA0000110
Um.... Today is Iwashita's birthday,[nl]so we were using party crackers....
WSB/WSB0000070

SSR/SSR0013460

CTG/CTG0014010

SSR/SSR0013470

RAK/RAK0054050
"Again", huh....[nl]Has this happened before?
CTG/CTG0014020
Well, it happened once during my birthday party[nl]back in elementary school....
SSR/SSR0013480
I-I-I'm sorry![nl]I've caused so much trouble for you all....
MRK/MRK0010730
Whatever, just get off of my darling Raku!
SSR/SSR0013490
Huh? Get off--
SSR/SSR0013500
Wait, WAAAAGH!?
SSR/SSR0013510
T-T-T-....This isn't what it looks like! I was just protecting[nl]you because you're the Mistress's boyfriend!
RAK/RAK0054060
No....don't even worry about it. Just make sure to assess[nl]the situation more carefully next time.
SSR/SSR0013520
Nghhh.....what a blunder.[nl]I'm so embarrassed, I can't face you all....
SSR/SSR0013530
P-Please excuse meeee!!
CTG/CTG0014030

WSA/WSA0000120
W-What's wrong, Tsugumi!?
SSR/SSR0013550
Someone in this room is trying to go after the Mistress![nl]Put your hands behind your back and get down!
SSR/SSR0013560
The gunfire came from around seven o'clock.... YOU!
MSA/MSA0000170
Eeeeeeeek![nl]I-It's not me!
SSR/SSR0013570
Then it's you!
MSB/MSB0000130
Aaaaaaagh! I-It's not me, either!

KSK/KSK0016730
Tsugumi, could you calm down, please?[nl]Take a good look around.
CTG/CTG0014050
