This is an incident, right?
WSA/WSA0000250
They've got us completely surrounded.
RAK/RAK0076690
Hm? It's getting pretty noisy....
CTG/CTG0023200
Everyone's looking out the window,[nl]what's going on out there?
RAK/RAK0076700
Let's see.
RAK/RAK0076710
....Gah!?

Division 4 is guarding the back gate. Division 6, we'd[nl]like you to patrol the area around the school.
PLA/PLA0000010G
Yes, ma'am!

RAK/RAK0076720
What the hell's going on!?
CTG/CTG0023210
The police....!?[nl]Why are they surrounding the school!?
RAK/RAK0076730
Maybe there's some really big incident around here!
@expose
CTG/CTG0023220
M-Maybe.... It's because of us?
RAK/RAK0076740
Gasp....![nl]Did our guys and the Beehive[nl]start fighting without us knowing!?
CTG/CTG0023230
The whole school's on alert![nl]That has to be it! Let's hurry up and stop them!
RAK/RAK0076750
Ghh! Dad, Ryuu....![nl]I'm begging you, don't do anything rash!
MRK/MRK0013600
Oh. It looks like divisions 4 and 6 are off today.
RAK/RAK0076760
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0013610
Jeez, I told them so many times they don't need to[nl]guard me *this* tightly....
CTG/CTG0023240
Hey....[nl]Does this have something to do with you?
MRK/MRK0013620
It does.[nl]These officers voluntarily guard me on their days off of work.
RAK/RAK0076770
That's too high of an alert....
CTG/CTG0023250
And here we were misunderstanding the whole situation.[nl]You're a real pain.
MRK/MRK0013630
I do apologize.[nl]I will reprimand them later, so please be patient for today.
MRK/MRK0013650
But there are less of them now than there used to be.
MRK/MRK0013660
Back in elementary school, the entire police force[nl]for the prefecture used to come and greet me.
MRK/MRK0013670
Thanks to that, our neighborhood had[nl]zero crime for six years. ♪
CTG/CTG0023270
I don't know if that's....a good thing or a bad thing.
MRK/MRK0013680
Do be careful, Raku dearest.[nl]These people think you're a bad man who dumped me.
RAK/RAK0076790
Huh!? Are the police watching me!?
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0013690
If you don't hurry up and marry me,[nl]it's possible you'll get arrested....perhaps. ♪[nl]Hehe.
