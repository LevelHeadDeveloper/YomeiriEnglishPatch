Waaagh!?

CTG/CTG0018830
Oh, it's just you, bean sprout.
What's that supposed to mean!?
Are you hurt?
RAK/RAK0070650
What's that supposed to mean!?[nl]So it's cool to run into someone, as long as it's me!?
CTG/CTG0018840
Sorry, sorry. That's not what I meant.
RAK/RAK0070660
Jeez, you ran into me so hard.[nl]You could've hurt yourself.
CTG/CTG0018850
.....Mgh.
CTG/CTG0018860
I'll say! It's your fault, too, for standing there[nl]on the left side of the corridor!
RAK/RAK0070670
Huh? What's wrong with standing on the left side?
CTG/CTG0018870
Well, doesn't it make more sense to be walking on the[nl]right side? Same as on the road.
RAK/RAK0070680
Huhh!? What're you talking about?[nl]You don't need to do that in the school corridor![nl]Besides, you need to drive on the *left* side of the road!
CTG/CTG0018880
....Ohhh, I see. I thought it was the right because[nl]I was still used to how they do it in America.
CTG/CTG0018890
But isn't it a bit weird?[nl]Why does Japan drive on the left?
RAK/RAK0070690
I dunno. Why does America drive on the right?
CTG/CTG0018900
I don't know.
CTG/CTG0018910
Anyway, the international standard is to drive on the right.[nl]So it's your fault for driving on the left.
RAK/RAK0070700
It's really arrogant to say that[nl]America = international standard. This is still Japan,[nl]so it's your fault for driving on the right.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0018920
Huh!? Uh, y-yeah....[nl]Are you okay?
RAK/RAK0070710
Yeah, that was nothing.
CTG/CTG0018930
I see, thank goodness.
CTG/CTG0018940
Sorry. I didn't think you'd be standing[nl]on the left side of the corridor....
RAK/RAK0070720
Hmm, why does what side I'm on matter?
CTG/CTG0018950
Well, walking on the right side make more sense, right?[nl]Same as on the road....
RAK/RAK0070730
No, no, no. Roads and corridors aren't the same thing.[nl]I mean, to begin with, roads use left-hand traffic.
CTG/CTG0018960
Ah, I see. Sorry. I thought it was the right because[nl]I was still used to how they do it in America.
CTG/CTG0018970
But this is a source of injury for foreigners. Why don't we[nl]make it so that you have to walk on the right side of the[nl]corridors, according to international standard?
RAK/RAK0070740
It's really arrogant to say that[nl]America = international standard. This is Japan, so if there's[nl]gonna be a standard, wouldn't the left make more sense?
MRK/MRK0011800
That's right!
CTG/CTG0018980
M-Marika!?
RAK/RAK0070750
....You came outta nowhere.
MRK/MRK0011810
I don't know the details, but my darling Raku cannot be[nl]wrong! So it's definitely correct to walk on the left side of[nl]the corridor!
CTG/CTG0018990
Ghh....I see you've got reinforcements, darling.[nl]So I'll....
CTG/CTG0019000
Tsugumiii!
SSR/SSR0020920
Yes, mistress!
CTG/CTG0019010
Hey, hey, do you think traffic in the corridors should be[nl]on the right side or the left side?[nl]I think it should be the right.
SSR/SSR0020930
The right.[nl]Without a doubt, and needless to say, it's the right.
MRK/MRK0011820
Left, it's left! It's absolutely the left!
SSR/SSR0020940
If *you're* saying so, then it's definitely the right.
CTG/CTG0019020
Hohoho....now it's two against two![nl]We're back to square one, darling!
RAK/RAK0070760
Dude....[nl]Why do you care about something so trivial....?
SYU/SYU0013510
If that's the case, I'll make everything crystal clear!
SYU/SYU0013520
Boys on the right! Girls on the left! That's right![nl]The ultimate answer!
SYU/SYU0013530
If both parties are walking on opposite sides, the rate of[nl]"where are you looking, you idiot!?" events will skyrocket![nl]It'll be a boost to a heart-pounding high school li--
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0013540
Owwwch!
RAK/RAK0070770
....We're not getting anywhere.
CTG/CTG0019030
That's true.[nl]We'll have to ask a neutral party....
CTG/CTG0019040
Heeeey, Kosakiiii!
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0019050
.....so we were discussing which side is better.[nl]What do you think, Kosaki?
MRK/MRK0011830
Left, left, left! It's definitely the left!
SSR/SSR0020950
Shut up, Marika Tachibana.[nl]This is strictly the chairperson's vote.
KSK/KSK0017860
U-Ummmm....
RAK/RAK0070780
Sorry for getting you involved in our nonsense, Onodera.
KSK/KSK0017870
N-No. That's okay....
KSK/KSK0017880
Well, I don't think it really matters what side you're on,[nl]as long as you don't run in the corridors, it should be fine,[nl]right?
........
CTG/CTG0019060G
....Right.
