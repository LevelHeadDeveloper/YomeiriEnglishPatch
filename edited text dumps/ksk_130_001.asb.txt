Hey, Ichijo. [nl]I know I already asked you for this once before, but could[nl]you do me a favor and teach Kosaki how to swim again?
RAK/RAK0050490
Huh? Me? I mean, I don't really mind....[nl](Heck, I actually welcome it.)[nl]But why are we doing it again?
@expose
RUR/RUR0011530
Same reason as before. The swim team has a practice meet,[nl]but we're short on members, so I've enlisted Kosaki to help.
RAK/RAK0050500
Onodera's not too good at swimming, right?[nl]Why not ask Chitoge or one of the others?
RUR/RUR0011540
You don't want to teach Kosaki how to swim?
RAK/RAK0050510
Uh, no, it's not like that....
RUR/RUR0011550
This is a numbers game, so we don't need a great swimmer. We would like to avoid having anyone drown, so if you could teach Kosaki the bare minimum, that would be great.
RUR/RUR0011560
Well, that's the plan, then, so thanks.[nl]I'll be waiting for you by the pool.
@expose
RAK/RAK0050520
Huh? Already?[nl]But I don't even have my swimsuit!
RUR/RUR0011570
I've rented one for you, so it's fine.[nl]Kosaki's already gone in ahead of me, so hurry up.
RAK/RAK0050530
....Man, you're pushy.
@時間経過演出
RUR/RUR0011580
Alright, I'll just be practicing by myself.[nl]I'll leave the rest to you.
KSK/KSK0015310
I-Ichijo![nl]Thanks for teaching me!
RAK/RAK0050540
S-Sure. You're welcome!
RAK/RAK0050550
(Ooooh, Onodera looks so cute in her swimsuit!)
RAK/RAK0050560
(....Wait, no, no.[nl] We have to teach Onodera how to swim![nl] Drop those stupid distractions and focus!)
RAK/RAK0050570
Ummmm, you've already done the warm-up exercises, right?[nl]Okay, so to start....
Practice the flutter kick
You gotta learn from experience!
RAK/RAK0050580
Let's start you off with some flutter kick practice[nl]using a kickboard. Once you've got the hang of that,[nl]you can try moving your arms.
KSK/KSK0015320
O-Okay....![nl]I'll do my best!
RAK/RAK0050590
Make sure relax your shoulders.[nl]If you're too stiff, you won't float.
KSK/KSK0015330
R-Relaxing![nl]I'll give it a shot!
RAK/RAK0050600
You look really stiff....
RAK/RAK0050610
O-kay, just like that, just like that.[nl]You're improving, little by little.
KSK/KSK0015340
Thank you, Ichijo.[nl]You're very dependable.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
RAK/RAK0050620
Huh!? D-Dependable? Me?[nl]I don't really think so....
KSK/KSK0015350
But you are.[nl]Look, remember the last time you were teaching[nl]me how to swim?
@expose
KSK/KSK0015360
When Chitoge's leg cramped up and she almost drowned,[nl]you were the first one to jump in and rescue her, Ichijo.[nl]Even back then, you were so dependable....
KSK/KSK0015370
....I'll even say that I was just a little[nl]envious of Chitoge. That's how cool you were.
RAK/RAK0050630
Onodera....
RAK/RAK0050640
(S-So that's what you thought of me!)
RAK/RAK0050650
Well....if you ever start drowning, Onodera,[nl]I'll come to your rescue immediately. That's a promise.
@ザクシャ小咲・中
KSK/KSK0015380
.....Okay. I'm counting on you, then!
RAK/RAK0050660
Well, of course, it's best if you don't drown to begin with.
KSK/KSK0015390
Hahahaha, that's true.[nl]I'll do my very best to learn how to swim!
RAK/RAK0050670
This is the sort of thing you have to learn by doing it.[nl]Practice is the only way!
KSK/KSK0015400
Huuuuuhhh!?
@時間経過演出
KSK/KSK0015410
Cough! Cough!
RAK/RAK0050680
O-Onodera!? Are you okay!?
KSK/KSK0015420
I-Ichijo....I'm sorry....[nl]I can't....do any more....
RUR/RUR0011590
Hahhh.....that didn't work at all....
