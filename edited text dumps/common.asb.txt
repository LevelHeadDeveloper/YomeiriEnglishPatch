Zawsze in love....
Forever in love....
You keep the lock....
....and I'll keep the key.
Hold it close to your heart, and keep it safe!
One day, when we're all grown up, we'll open the lock....
And then.....
We'll get married!
@pro_001_01
RAK/RAK0034230
Okay, is that enough salt....?[nl]Yep. That's good.
RYU/RYU0000820
Young master! Good mornin'!
RAK/RAK0034240
Hi, Ryuu. You're up early, as usual.
RYU/RYU0000830
I won't allow myself to just sleep idly while you[nl]cook us all breakfast, young master.
RYU/RYU0000840
Your food shall make us a million times stronger![nl]Today's the day we wipe out the Beehive gang for good!
RAK/RAK0034250
(That's right. We, the Shuei-gumi, are at odds with the[nl] Beehive gang... It wouldn't surprise me one bit[nl] if an all-out war broke out.)
RAK/RAK0034260
(We're just barely holding it back....)
RAP/RAP0000310
Hey, hey, you're sounding troublesome this morning.
RAK/RAK0034270
Dad....
RYU/RYU0000850
B-Boss![nl]Good mornin'!
RAP/RAP0000320
Ryuu, I already told you to simmer down for a while.[nl]If you or the young guys act out, [nl]won't Raku and his "girlfriend" be in trouble?
RYU/RYU0000860
Gwagghhhh!
RYU/RYU0000870
Y-y-y-yes! Tha's right![nl]I got a bit too fired up there![nl]Sorry 'bout that, young master!
RAK/RAK0034280
(I, Raku Ichijo, the only son of the Shuei-gumi leader,[nl] and Chitoge Kirisaki, the only daughter of[nl] the Beehive leader, are madly in love....)
RAK/RAK0034290
(....And that's really the only thing holding back[nl] an impending war between us....)
RAP/RAP0000330
Ha, ha, ha![nl]It must be hard being popular, huh?
RAK/RAK0034300
(Except that this whole thing was orchestrated by our[nl] damn fathers. Really, we don't love each other at all....[nl] We're just pretending to be dating.)
RAK/RAK0034310
(But if that's what it takes to stop this city from becoming a[nl] sea of fire, then....)
RAK/RAK0034320
That's right, Ryuu. It's alright to get a bit fired up,[nl]but don't do anything to upset Honey.
RYU/RYU0000880
Hahh, yer right, my bad....[nl]That would be pretty stupid....
RYU/RYU0000890
I won't lay a finger on anyone, I'm drawin' the line!!
RAK/RAK0034330
Stop getting all fired up on me so early![nl]I won't give you breakfast.
RYU/RYU0000900
Y-You can't mean that, young master!?
RAP/RAP0000340
Oh....That's right, Raku.[nl]I forgot to ask you earlier,[nl]but I need a favor from you after breakfast.
RAK/RAK0034340
A favor?
RAP/RAP0000350
I need you to make some inari sushi[nl]as an offering.
RAK/RAK0034350
Huh? Inari sushi?
RAK/RAK0034360
Well, I wouldn't really mind, but....[nl]What do you mean, "as an offering"?
RAP/RAP0000360
You know that big shrine nearby?[nl]The priest there is an old friend of mine.
RAP/RAP0000370
He's going overseas for a month, so he asked me[nl]to take care of all the cleaning and stuff for him.
RAP/RAP0000380
Well, I'm having the young guys do most of it,[nl]but I'd like your help with one of the smaller shrines[nl]in the outskirts of the city.
RAK/RAK0034370
Oh, so the inari sushi is an offering there, then.[nl]I don't really mind, but you should have asked me earlier.
RAP/RAP0000390
I already told you, I forgot.[nl]We have all the ingredients.
RAK/RAK0034380
Okay, got it.
RAK/RAK0034390
Alright.....[nl]I managed to make it here to drop off the offerings[nl]before I had to be at school....
RAK/RAK0034400
It must be pretty dusty here.[nl]I can't imagine it would be easy to clean this place,[nl]since it's at the edge of the city.
RAK/RAK0034410
Well then....I don't have a ton of time,[nl]but I can clean up a little right now.
OTM/OTM0002300
Mhm! Thou art a good-hearted young man.
RAK/RAK0034420
Hm?
RAK/RAK0034430
(I thought I heard something just now....[nl] ....Was it just my imagination?)
RAK/RAK0034440
Well, forget that. I'll have to come back later for the[nl]serious cleaning, but I can get some of this dust away[nl]right now, and put down this inari sushi....
RAK/RAK0034450
Alright, finished.[nl]I guess, since I came all the way to this shrine,[nl]I might as well make a wish.
RAK/RAK0034460
(If we're offering inari sushi, that would make this[nl] an inari shrine....)
RAK/RAK0034470
What sort of wish would I make at an inari shrine?
