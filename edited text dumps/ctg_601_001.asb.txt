(Am I seriously giving up now....?)
RAK/RAK0083200
(If I don't do something, Chitoge will disappear![nl] If I don't act now, when *can* I act!?)
RAK/RAK0083210
(Am I really, really giving up!?)
Don't give up
Give up
RAK/RAK0083220
(Heck no! I'll find Chitoge if it costs me my life!)

RAK/RAK0083230
(After all, some things just can't be done....)
RAK/RAK0083240
(Sorry, Chitoge....[nl] I was an unreliable boyfriend right up to the end....)

RAK/RAK0006180
(Crap....since there's guards everywhere,[nl] I can't find Chitoge!)
RAK/RAK0006190
(Chitoge....[nl] Where the hell are you!?)
MTG/MTG0001810
Mr. Raku....
RAK/RAK0006200
Waaaagh!? M-Mitoge!?
RAK/RAK0006210
(Oh no, they've found me....!)
MTG/MTG0001820
You're looking for the real me, right?
MTG/MTG0001830
In that case....follow me, please.
RAK/RAK0006220
Huh!?
MTG/MTG0001840
I know myself.
MTG/MTG0001850
All I needed to do was think about where I'd hide[nl]if I were in her position.
MTG/MTG0001860
Hurry up. Before the others find us.
RAK/RAK0006230
Ummmm....
Sure, lead the way
I don't trust you
MTG/MTG0001870
This way.
MTG/MTG0001880
RAK/RAK0006240
I'm sorry, but I'm not that trusting.[nl]You're just gonna lead me back to the others, aren't you?
MTG/MTG0001890
No....you misunderstand!
MTG/MTG0001900
I'm begging you, Mr. Raku![nl]You need to believe me! There isn't enough time!
Alright....I trust you
No thanks
RAK/RAK0006250
You say that, but earlier, you didn't say anything[nl]during the engagement ceremony. Deep down,[nl]you were just trying to get us engaged, weren't you?
MTG/MTG0001910
That's....
MTG/MTG0001920
Up until then, I certainly had some doubts.
MTG/MTG0001930
But now--
CTP/CTP0000170
Found you. Raku.
RAK/RAK0006260G
!!
CTP/CTP0000180
I know having to face something as big[nl]as getting engaged can be overwhelming....
CTP/CTP0000190
But what you said earlier was too much.[nl]Don't you feel bad about what you said to Chitoge?
MTG/MTG0001950
Dad, no. I was....
CTP/CTP0000200
It's a shame. I'd have thought you were the sort of[nl]young man with a better sense of time, place, and occasion.
CTP/CTP0000210
But there's no going back now.[nl]I'll ask you to please return to the venue.
RAK/RAK0006270
(It's over....it's all over....)

@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0006280
What....why are you being so nice to me?
MTG/MTG0001960
....After what you told me earlier, I started thinking.[nl]And I thought, what if we, "Chitoge Kirisaki", misunderstood?
MTG/MTG0001970
Mr. Raku, you really did care about me,[nl]but I went and created this alternate self to try to be cool.
MTG/MTG0001980
Really, it's this alternate self that you don't need.[nl]A Chitoge Kirisaki that's perfect in every way[nl]is unnatural, no matter how you look at it.
RAK/RAK0006290
But that's---
MTG/MTG0001990
Please go wake up the girl who's resigned herself[nl]to disappearing. And I want you to tell her[nl]"You're not unwanted".
RAK/RAK0006300
----
RAK/RAK0006310
Is that alright? With you?
MTG/MTG0002000
Huh?
RAK/RAK0006320
I mean, if I save the original Chitoge,[nl]that means you'll disappear, right?
MTG/MTG0002010
Well....I've been prepared for that since the beginning.
MTG/MTG0002020
And, like I said before, even if I disappear,[nl]my feelings will remain.
MTG/MTG0002030
As long as Chitoge Kirisaki is happy with Raku Ichijo,[nl]I'll be happy, too.
RAK/RAK0006330
Wow, I guess you really are a "good girl"....
MTG/MTG0002040
Hahahaha, cut it out.[nl]It sounds like you're making a really bad joke.
RAK/RAK0006340
MTG/MTG0002050
Alright, here we are.[nl]She should be in here, curled up in a ball.
RAK/RAK0006350
....I see.
RAK/RAK0006360
Alright, thanks. Take care....[nl]That feels weird to say.
MTG/MTG0002060
No. I wish you a long and happy life with the real me.
MTG/MTG0002070
Um....one more thing....[nl]We all had a great time at that amusement park.
MTG/MTG0002080
If it's alright with you,[nl]do you mind going again with Chitoge?[nl]....Just the two of you?
RAK/RAK0006370
Yeah, of course.[nl]I promise.
MTG/MTG0002090
Thank you, Mr. Raku.
RAK/RAK0006380
You too. Thanks, Mitoge.
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0006390
Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0007450
CTG/CTG0007460
Huh? Raku?
RAK/RAK0006400
Jeez, will you quit moping around?[nl]It's not like you at all!
CTG/CTG0007470
Huh? But what about the engagement ceremony?[nl]Raku, I thought you were getting engaged to Mitoge!
RAK/RAK0006410
I got outta there right in the middle of it.
@expose
CTG/CTG0007480
Why....why the hell would you do that?
RAK/RAK0006420
Because you shouldn't get engaged[nl]to someone you don't love!
RAK/RAK0006430
And Mitoge isn't the one I love....[nl]It's you, Chitoge!!
CTG/CTG0007490
....Huh?
CTG/CTG0007500
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHH!?
CTG/CTG0007510
B-But, that's.....that's absurd![nl]She's way more appealing than I am!
CTG/CTG0007520
I mean, I'm just a lazy girl who can't[nl]even take care of a few animals, right!?
RAK/RAK0006440
Yeah. Totally irresponsible.
RAK/RAK0006450
But if I was the only one taking care of them,[nl]with how meticulous I am, I'd never finish the job.
RAK/RAK0006460
I gotta say, we've got great synergy.
CTG/CTG0007530
Y-You really think so?
CTG/CTG0007540
But I've also got other shortcomings[nl]too numerous to even list.
CTG/CTG0007550
I'm afraid of the dark....
RAK/RAK0006470
So don't go in dark places.
CTG/CTG0007560
I've got the brute strength of a gorilla....
RAK/RAK0006480
Better to have that than not have it.[nl]No other girl can break concrete. It's a rare trait.
CTG/CTG0007570
Is that a compliment....?
RAK/RAK0006490
Yeah.
CTG/CTG0007580
But....I can't even begin to cook....
RAK/RAK0006500
It would be a good idea to start learning.[nl]You couldn't possibly get worse, and there's a lot[nl]of room for improvement.
RAK/RAK0006510
So have a little faith in yourself.
CTG/CTG0007590
Hmph, what is this....![nl]For such a bean sprout, you're acting awfully manly....
CTG/CTG0007600
Trying to butter me up with all these good....[nl]What the hell do you want!?
RAK/RAK0006520
That....should be fairly obvious.
@ctg_006_501
CTG/CTG0007610
Huh? Sorry....[nl]I didn't quite catch that.
RAK/RAK0006530
Sorry....just gimme a sec.
RAK/RAK0006540
(Gaaaaaah![nl] What the hell am I even saying!?)
