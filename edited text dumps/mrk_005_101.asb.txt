Did you know?
MRK/MRK0005720
This aquarium has a legend regarding couples....
MRK/MRK0005730
Raku dearest. Do you know what[nl]happens to the couples?
What's the legend about?
They find eternal happiness?
They break up
@ザクシャ万里花・１
MRK/MRK0005740
That's right. As expected of my darling Raku,[nl]you understand so well.
MRK/MRK0005750
The legend says that any couple that kisses here[nl]will find eternal happiness.
MRK/MRK0005760
In a kind of....girly way,[nl]I also have an interest in this kind of story.
MRK/MRK0005770
Of course, I wouldn't have any kind of interest[nl]if you weren't my partner.
@mrk_005_102
MRK/MRK0005780
If that's what it's about,[nl]then it doesn't involve us.
MRK/MRK0005790
After all, there is no way Raku dearest and I[nl]would separate so easily.
You won't separate?
How can you say for sure?
Since when are we dating?
MRK/MRK0005800
My feelings are always connected[nl]with you on a spiritual level.
MRK/MRK0005810
That's how I can say for sure.
@ザクシャ万里花・１
MRK/MRK0005820
I've always felt like we were dating.
MRK/MRK0005830
Therefore, I'm not wrong.
MRK/MRK0005840
Haha. You agree, then!
MRK/MRK0005850
By the way....
MRK/MRK0005860
The correct answer is that any couple[nl]that kisses here will find eternal happiness.
MRK/MRK0005870
Well, legend or no legend,[nl]it's up to you to find your own happiness.
MRK/MRK0005880
Haha, don't you understand?
