RUR/RUR0009980
From the beginning.
RAK/RAK0043880
Whaaaat!?
RUR/RUR0009990
....Listen up. Even if she's talking to someone else,[nl]or is on her way to the staff room for an errand, if you[nl]want to talk to her, just go talk to her.
RAK/RAK0043890
W-Well, it's not like I had anything important[nl]to talk to her about, okay?
RUR/RUR0010000
I told you! If you wanna talk to her,[nl]just talk to her, whatever the reason.
RAK/RAK0043900
Ngh....[nl]W-Well, you've got a point.
RAK/RAK0043910
