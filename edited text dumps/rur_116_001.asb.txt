Miyamoto, you haven't left for home yet?
RUR/RUR0009640
No, I promised to leave with Kosaki,[nl]and I'm waiting for her to finish her errands.
RAK/RAK0043410
So, Onodera hasn't left either?
RUR/RUR0009650
Right. She should be back pretty soon.
RAK/RAK0043420
....I-I see.
RAK/RAK0043430
(What should I say?)
I'll hang around, too
I've gotta go home and make dinner
RAK/RAK0043440
I think I'll hang around for a bit.[nl]May as well do some prep work for tomorrow....
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0009660
Do whatever you want.
RAK/RAK0043450
....By the way, whatcha doing on your phone, Miyamoto?[nl]Playing a game?
RUR/RUR0009670
No, I'm reading the news.
RUR/RUR0009680
The number of non-standard workers has increased sharply[nl]in recent years, but I wonder if that will help Japanese[nl]companies gain enough resources to support themselves in the future.
RAK/RAK0043460
O-Okay....?
RUR/RUR0009690
By the time we get into the job market,[nl]I think the issues with sales taxes and pensions will be much[nl]more serious than they are now.
RUR/RUR0009700
With that in mind, even with the rising GDP,[nl]you can't be too careful, can you? You need to start hedging[nl]resources and gathering information as soon as possible.
RAK/RAK0043470
Uh....well....[nl]That's amazing, Miyamoto. I don't think I've ever[nl]put *that* much thought into the future.
RUR/RUR0009710
It never hurts to be knowledgable.[nl]I recommend reading the news when you have some[nl]free time.
RAK/RAK0043480
S-Sure....
RAK/RAK0043490
(She's amazing....)
RAK/RAK0043500
Gah! I've gotta head home early today[nl]so I can start dinner....!

'K.
RAK/RAK0043510
Miyamoto, when Onodera gets back,[nl]please give her my regards.
RUR/RUR0009730
Got it.
RUR/RUR0009740
If you like her so much, why not tell her yourself?
RAK/RAK0043520
Hm? Did you say something?
RUR/RUR0009750
Just talking to myself.
