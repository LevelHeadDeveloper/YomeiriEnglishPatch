Hey, Tsugumi. Going home by yourself today?
SSR/SSR0015500
You know from one look.[nl]Claude's taken over looking after the Mistress today.
SSR/SSR0015510
You're not going home with her,[nl]even though you're her boyfriend?
RAK/RAK0056060
She's going shoping with her classmates.[nl]Why don't you go with her?
SSR/SSR0015520
No....I'm good.[nl]Whenever I go shopping with her, she always makes me[nl]try on all kinds of clothes and stuff to be fashionable.
RAK/RAK0056070
(To be honest, she looks great in just about anything.)
SSR/SSR0015530
So, I'll be leaving, then. See ya.
RAK/RAK0056080
Okay.

SSR/SSR0015540
HEEEY, YOU! Why are you following me!?
RAK/RAK0056090
I-I'm not! I just wanted to go to this supermarket, too!
SSR/SSR0015550
What, so you're also shopping for dinner?
RAK/RAK0056100
Pretty much.[nl]So you're doing the same thing?
SSR/SSR0015560
Ghh.... To think I'd end up in the same store as you.
RAK/RAK0056110
Do you hate it that much?
SSR/SSR0015570
I wouldn't say I *hate* it....[nl]But if someone were to see us here--

CTP/CTP0000240
Oh, my, this is quite the unexpected pairing.
SSR/SSR0015580
Waaagh!?
RAK/RAK0056120
Uh....Chitoge's dad!?
CTP/CTP0000250
Good evening, Raku. And you too, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0015590
B-B-B-B-B-Boss![nl]What are you doing here!?
CTP/CTP0000260
This is the city we live in.[nl]That being the case, I like to walk around[nl]from time to time and see what's going on.
CTP/CTP0000270
I certainly wasn't expecting to see the two of you[nl]shopping together. You two must be very close, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0015600
Y-You misunderstand, Boss![nl]I'm not friends with this guy at all!
CTP/CTP0000280
Hahaha.... If you keep denying it so vehemently,[nl]you'll make Raku feel bad.
SSR/SSR0015610
Uhh! S-Sorry!
CTP/CTP0000290
Raku. Tsugumi, like Chitoge,[nl]is a valuable member of my family.
CTP/CTP0000300
I'm sure it's thanks in part to you that she[nl]can enjoy her school life here.
CTP/CTP0000310
So please take good care of both[nl]Tsugumi and Chitoge for me.
RAK/RAK0056130
S-Sure.... I will.
SSR/SSR0015620
Boss....
CTP/CTP0000320
Oops....I think I'd better be going.[nl]Well then, please excuse me.
SSR/SSR0015630
H-Have a good night!
SSR/SSR0015640
Hahh.....
RAK/RAK0056140
Man, that was unexpected.[nl]I didn't think we'd run into Chitoge's dad.
RAK/RAK0056150
Seems like you get pretty nervous around him.
SSR/SSR0015650
Well, of course I do![nl]I think of him as the boss of the Beehive before[nl]I think of him as the Mistress's father.
RAK/RAK0056160
He doesn't look it to me.[nl]He seemed so kind just now.
SSR/SSR0015660
If you ever deign to betray the Mistress,[nl]rest assured you will be subjected to his scary side.[nl]Well, I'll probably have eliminated you before then.
RAK/RAK0056170
Don't say such scary things out of the blue....
SSR/SSR0015670
But usually he's as gentle as he seems.[nl]Perhaps it's because I'm around the same age as[nl]the Mistress, but he's always concerned for me as well.
RAK/RAK0056180
(Wow....I never thought I'd see her make a face like this.[nl] I guess that's just how much she respects him....)
SSR/SSR0015680
Alright....let's get back on track.
RAK/RAK0056190
Hm?
SSR/SSR0015690
....Grocery shopping. You're coming too, right?
Is that okay?
No, thanks.
RAK/RAK0056200
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
SSR/SSR0015700
The boss already saw us together....[nl]So I'll give you a special pass this time.
RAK/RAK0056210
I don't like how you're looking down on me....[nl]Well, whatever.
RAK/RAK0056220
After all, Chitoge's dad did ask me[nl]to take care of you, too.
SSR/SSR0015710
Whaa!? I didn't ask you to or anything!
RAK/RAK0056230
Right, right. Hurry up,[nl]or we'll miss the time sale.
SSR/SSR0015720
Ghh....I'll remember this, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0056240
Hmmm, I think I'll be going.
SSR/SSR0015730
Huh?
RAK/RAK0056250
We got lucky with Chitoge's dad being the one who[nl]saw us.... But you never know who else might come along.
SSR/SSR0015740
I see...
RAK/RAK0056260
So I think I'll head to another supermarket today.[nl]See ya, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0015750
Yeah, see you later.
