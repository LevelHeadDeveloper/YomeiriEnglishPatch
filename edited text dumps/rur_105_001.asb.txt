Mph.... oof....
RAK/RAK0042170
(Hm? Is that Miyamoto?[nl] Why is she holding so many papers!?)
RAK/RAK0042180
Heeeeey, Miyamoto!
RUR/RUR0008620
Oh, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0042190
I'll help you carry those papers.[nl]It'd be a lot of work for you otherwise.
RUR/RUR0008630
Really? Then could you take half of them?[nl]We're going to the staff room. Thanks.
RAK/RAK0042200
Sure! Leave it to me.
@時間経過演出
RUR/RUR0008640
....You really are kind to everyone.
RAK/RAK0042210
Really? I've never really[nl]thought of myself that way before....
RUR/RUR0008650
....Kosaki's usually nice to everyone as well.[nl]I don't think she's quite as aware of it as you are, though.
RUR/RUR0008660
I guess you two are pretty similar that way....
RAK/RAK0042220
I'm not sure about me, but you're right about Onodera being[nl]kind! After all, she has a pure heart, she's humble, and[nl]she's cute. She's also reserved, but reliable to the bone.

RAK/RAK0042230
Onodera's, like, a super great person!
........
RAK/RAK0042240
Oh, sorry....[nl]Got a bit carried away there.
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0008670
No need to apologize.
RUR/RUR0008680
But you're right.[nl]I mostly agree with your opinion on her,[nl]but why don't you tell her instead of telling me?
RUR/RUR0008690
After all, there's not many people in this world[nl]who wouldn't feel good about being complimented.
RAK/RAK0042250
....I see.[nl]Makes sense when you put it like that.
RUR/RUR0008700
Yeah, do your best.
RAK/RAK0042260
(Whether or not I'd actually be able to[nl] tell her is a whole other matter....)
