ANA/ANA0000100
This is today's Kitty of the Day.[nl]Mikke, a three-year old calico.
ANA/ANA0000110
While her owner is at work, Mikke stays at home by herself.[nl]When she hears her owner's footsteps, she goes running[nl]to the door to greet him.
ANA/ANA0000120
She feels safe and content with her owner around.[nl]Sometimes, she even falls asleep without realizing....
RAK/RAK0038190
Ahhh, so cuuute....[nl]It's like a shower for the soul.
OTM/OTM0004000
Nom nom nom....
OTM/OTM0004010
Thou art already the animal caretaker at thy school, correct?[nl]Dost thou not spend every day surrounded by cute animals?
RAK/RAK0038200
Well, that is true.[nl]I can't say they're very fond of me, though....
RAK/RAK0038210
Ahhh, I wish I was as popular with animals[nl]as Mikke's master.
@expose
.....
RAK/RAK0038220
Welp, I'm not Onodera, so that's basically impossible.[nl]Okay, I'm off to school.
OTM/OTM0004020
....Mhm.

Come on, Rodriguez IV.[nl]It's time for your long-awaited meal.
CTG/CTG0010990
This again. You must be crazy to put in[nl]this much love even though he doesn't love you.
RAK/RAK0038240
Don't say that. Maybe one day he'll reciprocate.
CTG/CTG0011000
You're too much of a romantic.[nl]We've had him forever and you still haven't grown on him,[nl]so I can't imagine it'll ever happen....
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0038250
Hm? What is it?
CTG/CTG0011010
What the....[nl]The animals are all surrounding you.
RAK/RAK0038260
....Huh? Whaaa!?[nl]W-What's wrong with all these guys!?
DOG/DOG0000020
*whine whine*
CAT/CAT0000060
Meowww, meeeooowww....
RAK/RAK0038270
W-What's going on....!?[nl]The animals are all....coming towards me!?
CTG/CTG0011020
No way!! I can't believe that they'd suddenly[nl]get so friendly after this long being cold to you!
RAK/RAK0038280
Has....my hard work finally all paid off....?
RAK/RAK0038290
Of course, that must be it....![nl]*sniffle*....
CTG/CTG0011030
Hey, dude....![nl]This isn't anything to be crying over.
RAK/RAK0038300
I-I'm not crying![nl]I'm just sweating a little around my eyes!
CTG/CTG0011040
No, you're definitely crying.[nl]It's super obvious....
RAK/RAK0038310
Alright everyone, gather 'round and let me pet you![nl]Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy!!
RAK/RAK0038320
Check it out, Chitoge![nl]I've got them wrapped around my finger...!
CTG/CTG0011050
I....see....
RAK/RAK0038330
Maaan, this is amazing![nl]I can't believe this is finally happening!
RAK/RAK0038340
Right, Chitoge?
RAK/RAK0038350
Huh? Chitoge?[nl]Why'd you suddenly go silent?
RAK/RAK0038360
Are you not feeling well or something?
CTG/CTG0011060
....No. Nothing like that.
RAK/RAK0038370
.....Huh? Ch-Chitoge?[nl]Why are you leaning on me? You feel heavy....
CTG/CTG0011070
....Because. It makes me feel so good[nl]to be near you....
RAK/RAK0038380
....Huh? Uh, w-what?[nl]What's wrong with you?
CTG/CTG0011080
Nothiiiing.[nl]Absolutely nooothiiinngg.
RAK/RAK0038390
N-No! You've gone crazy!
CTG/CTG0011090
Heheh....[nl]Whaddya think *this* is?
RAK/RAK0038400
.....Hey!?[nl]Where'd you get that rope from!?
CTG/CTG0011100
Heheheheh....[nl]We're boyfriend and girlfriend, so it'll be fine, right?
RAK/RAK0038410
Huh? What.... What's that even supposed to mean!?[nl]A rope? Uh, could you maybe put it away.[nl]W-What are you doing with that rope!?
CTG/CTG0011110
Hehehehehehehehehe....[nl]Rakuuu, be a doll and come here....
RAK/RAK0038420
Eeeek! W-What's going on!?
CTG/CTG0011120
Don't run awaaaaay![nl]Wait for me, Rakuuuuuu!
RAK/RAK0038430
Hahh, hahh....[nl]I think I managed to escape....maybe....?
RAK/RAK0038440
(What was she gonna do to me with that rope?[nl] No, no, first of all, how'd I end up in this situation!?)
KSK/KSK0009000
Oh, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0038450
O-Onodera....?
KSK/KSK0009010
What's the matter?[nl]You seem out of breath.
RAK/RAK0038460
Uh, well.... It's nothing.[nl]You going home now, Onodera?
KSK/KSK0009020
Yeah, I was just thinking I should probably get home.[nl]And you have to take care of the animals around now, right?
RAK/RAK0038470
Yeah. That's right....
KSK/KSK0009030
Um, if you'd like....[nl]Can I help you with that?
RAK/RAK0038480
Huh? ....For real?[nl]Wait, no. Not right now!
KSK/KSK0009040
Huh? Why not?
RAK/RAK0038490
Right now, there's a bit of a....[nl]I wouldn't say it's a huge problem, but it's a problem.
KSK/KSK0009050
Problem....?[nl]Is something wrong with the animals?
RAK/RAK0038500
No, it's not the animals....[nl]It's Chitoge, she's acting kinda weird. I think she'll stop[nl]at some point, but I'm not sure.
RAK/RAK0038510
Onodera?
RAK/RAK0038520
Hello, Onodera? Helllooooo?
@ＢＧＭ再生
KSK/KSK0009060
....Ichijo.
KSK/KSK0009070
....if I may....[nl]Can I hug you for a little while?
RAK/RAK0038530
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0038540
(I-I-I-I'm.....!?[nl] Onodera's about to hug me, for real!?!?)
RAK/RAK0038550
W-W-W-W-W-What's the matter, Onodera?
KSK/KSK0009080
Ahhhh.... So waaaarmm....
RAK/RAK0038560
Warm....? Oh![nl]Don't tell me you've caught a cold!
RAK/RAK0038570
Of course! Otherwise, she'd never say something like that....[nl]Onodera, I'll bet you have a fever. Let's get you to the[nl]infirmary so we can take your temperature, okay?
KSK/KSK0009090
Ichijo, that's not it.[nl]It's not like that at allll....
KSK/KSK0009100
It's just....[nl]I wanted to be a little bit closer to you, is all....
RAK/RAK0038580
Whaaaaa!?!?[nl]W-What do you mean by that....?
RAK/RAK0038590
When you say things like that, I can't help[nl]but get my hopes up-- Or I should say...
KSK/KSK0009110
Hehehehe. You wanna know?[nl]Hey, you wanna know the truth?
RAK/RAK0038600
(A-Aaah....!?[nl] Onodera's face keep getting closer and closer!)
RAK/RAK0038610
(N-N-No! If this keeps up,[nl] I'll lose all sense of rationality....!)

RAK/RAK0038630
T-Tachibana!?[nl]Where'd you come from....?
MRK/MRK0009520
I can't believe you'd pull something like this, Onodera![nl]Just what on earth is going on here!?
KSK/KSK0009130
Aahhhhh.....?[nl]What is it, Marika?
MRK/MRK0009530
??[nl]Huh? Onodera?
KSK/KSK0009140
Yesss?
MRK/MRK0009540
Pardon me, Raku dearest.[nl]Is something wrong with Onodera today?
RAK/RAK0038640
I-I think so. After all,[nl]she's acting pretty weirdly, right?
KSK/KSK0009150
It's not weird. Maybe youuu're the one[nl]acting weeiiird, Ichijooo? Hehehehehehehe....
RAK/RAK0038650
Definitely weird....[nl]Onodera, what's gotten into you?[nl]Did you hit your head or something?
MRK/MRK0009550
Sometimes when *I'm* around you, Raku dearest,[nl]I get swept away and act crazy in spite of myself,[nl]though not in the same way as Onodera....
RAK/RAK0038660
Huh? Is that right?
MRK/MRK0009560
Yes. Whenever you look at me, my heart goes aflutter,[nl]and I lose control over myself....
RAK/RAK0038670
....Tachibana?
MRK/MRK0009570
*sniffle*
RAK/RAK0038680
Um....Ms. Tachibana?
MRK/MRK0009580
*sob*[nl]R-Rakky....
RAK/RAK0038690
Huh!? H-Hey! Why do you suddenly look like[nl]you're about to start crying!?
MRK/MRK0009590
How am I gonna make Rakky fall for me[nl]when I keep gettin' like this?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0009600
Rakky.... RAAAKKKYYYY!
RAK/RAK0038700
T-T-Tachibana! Hang on a second![nl]I don't follow what you're saying at all!
MRK/MRK0009610
Oh, that's it![nl]I just had a fantastic idea!
RAK/RAK0038710
Huh?
MRK/MRK0009620
If I want to stay with my darling Raku,[nl]I just need to lock him in with a "fait accompli"!
RAK/RAK0038720
Wha.... Huh?[nl]What do you mean "fait accompli"?
MRK/MRK0009630
Hey Raku dearest.[nl]What say we start making ourselves some children?
RAK/RAK0038730
WHAAAEAAAAAAA!?
MRK/MRK0009650
Well, Raku dearest? Don't you think that's a lovely idea?[nl]Come on, let's get started!
RAK/RAK0038740
N-No, no! Wait a minute! There's something[nl]really weird about the direction this is taking!
MRK/MRK0009660
No, no, there's nothing strange about this at all. ★
MRK/MRK0009670
Come on, Raku dearest! Let's go to my house![nl]Immediately! That's right! Immediately!
RAK/RAK0038750
(W-W-What the hell!?[nl] Her eyes are all bloodshot!)
KSK/KSK0009160
Ichijoooooo.....
MRK/MRK0009680

Hahh, hahh....[nl]W-What just happened?
RAK/RAK0038790
Should I just go home?[nl]But I still haven't finished taking care of the animals....![nl]Oh, jeez, what do I do?
CLD/CLD0001810
Don't move.
RAK/RAK0038800
Hyaaaaaaaaagh!?[nl]I've been caught!
RAK/RAK0038810
Wait, huh? Claude!?
RAK/RAK0038820
Don't scare me like that....[nl]I've already had far too many weird things happen[nl]to me today.
RAK/RAK0038830
Oh, that's right, Claude![nl]At this point, I don't care who I ask for help![nl]Chitoge's been acting really weird!
CLD/CLD0001820
I have something I wish to say to you.
RAK/RAK0038840
Huh? No, but like, Chitoge's been acting really weird![nl]You can't just ignore that!
CLD/CLD0001830
Before that, I have something I'd like to tell you.
RAK/RAK0038850
Huh? What is it?
RAK/RAK0038860
Uh, well, we can start with your thing if you want,[nl]but don't be so close to me when you say it! What's the[nl]point of telling me this thing while hugging me!?
CLD/CLD0001840
Oh, trust me, there's a point.
RAK/RAK0038870
Huh....?
CLD/CLD0001850
Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0038880
Ummm....[nl]Hey, why are you looking at me with sparkling eyes?
CLD/CLD0001860
Raku Ichijo. Ever since I laid eyes on you, I've....
RAK/RAK0038890
Huh? ....Huuuhhh!?
CLD/CLD0001870
Since I saw you, I've lo--
SSR/SSR0010670
Are you okay!?
RAK/RAK0038900
T-Tsugumiiiii!
RAK/RAK0038910
Ohh, you're my savior![nl]Are you normal!? You're normal, right?
SSR/SSR0010680
Quick! Come this way!
SSR/SSR0010690
They won't find us for a while in here.
RAK/RAK0038920
T-Thanks, Tsugumi. You really saved me....
RAK/RAK0038930
There's something weird going on with everyone today![nl]I-Is it some kind of prank? If so, that'd be a real shock....
SSR/SSR0010700
RAK/RAK0038940
W-What is it, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0010710
How do your lips taste?
RAK/RAK0038950
Huh?
SSR/SSR0010720
For a long, long time....I've been curious about that.
SSR/SSR0010730
Would you....show me, perhaps....?
RAK/RAK0038960
N-N-N-NOT YOU TOOOOOO!
SSR/SSR0010740
Waaaait! I won't let you escape!
RAK/RAK0038970
(This isn't normal! Not at all![nl] This is definitely weird!)
RAK/RAK0038980
(This isn't the time to be worrying about the animals![nl] I've got to get outta this school ASAP!)
