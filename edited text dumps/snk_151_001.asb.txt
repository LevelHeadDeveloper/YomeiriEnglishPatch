....Come in, Raku. How's it going in there?
RAK/RAK0028600
This is Raku, I've successfully infiltrated[nl]the Kirisaki residence.
RAK/RAK0028610
There's a few middle-aged dudes on guard,[nl]but so far, no one's seen me yet.
SYU/SYU0002690
Alright. That's a great start.[nl]Keep searching.
SYU/SYU0002700
But keep in mind you're breaking into a girl's house.[nl]Don't make any loud noises.
RAK/RAK0028620
Well, this is Chitoge's house,[nl]or I should say a gang's hideout....[nl]If they find me, I won't get off scot-free.
RAK/RAK0028630
You're a real bastard, Shuu, making your[nl]friend sneak into a place like this.
SYU/SYU0002710
I'm not Shuu. Call me Colonel.[nl]There's a chance the enemy will intercept this frequency.
RAK/RAK0028640
Jeez, why are you so flippant....[nl]Anyway, there's no frequency to intercept.[nl]We're using cellphones.
SYU/SYU0002720
....Well, joking aside.
SYU/SYU0002730
I didn't want you in harm's way, either.
SYU/SYU0002740
But unless we get that thing back,[nl]we won't live to see tomorrow....
RAK/RAK0028650
Yeah, I know.[nl]I never thought I'd have to enter a gang's hideout[nl]to swap out a single DVD....
SYU/SYU0002750
Well, you're supposed to be Kirisaki's boyfriend,[nl]after all. If you're caught, she'd probably[nl]forgive you by only half-killing you, right?
RAK/RAK0028660
You bastard, pretending this is someone else's problem....[nl]If that scary Four-Eyes finds me, he'll probably kill me completely.
SYU/SYU0002760
Well, whatever you do, make sure to sneak into[nl]Kirisaki's room without being seen.
SYU/SYU0002770
If they're having a pajama party, they'll probably[nl]watch the movie around midnight, when they've run out[nl]of things to talk about.
RAK/RAK0028670
There's still time to sneak in, then....[nl]I'll just have to keep an eye on these old gangsters,[nl]and move slowly and unhurriedly.
SYU/SYU0002780
Well then, let's start the mission to get back[nl]that super-special video! Good luck....!
