Owwww.....[nl]Aggh, my aching back....
SSR/SSR0019360
What's wrong, Raku Ichijo?[nl]You look like an old man.
RAK/RAK0060050
Well, my body's screaming for help....
SSR/SSR0019370
Heh. I'll bet it's because you're lazy[nl]and don't get enough exercise.
RAK/RAK0060060
If anything, it's probably because you and Chitoge[nl]are always beating up on me....
SSR/SSR0019380
W-Well, that's because you---!
RAK/RAK0060070
Look, you were about to hit me again![nl]I'm not feeling well, so please cut me a break!

--! I-I see....
SSR/SSR0019400
It can't be helped....[nl]I'll give you this, and you'd better get yourself in shape.
SSR/SSR0019410
The best way to recover from fatigue[nl]is to get extra vitamins.
RAK/RAK0060080
Oh, thanks....
RAK/RAK0060090
(I'm thankful, alright,[nl] but if she'd stop beating me up, that would be a much[nl] bigger help than giving me this....)
