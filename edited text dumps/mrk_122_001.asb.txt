RAK/RAK0078270
Phewww.... Today's finally over.[nl]Let's head home, guys!
CTG/CTG0023440
Oh, sorry, Raku![nl]I've got some stuff I need to take care of at home today,[nl]so I've gotta rush!
SSR/SSR0021300
I'll be going with her.
KSK/KSK0018240
U-Umm....[nl]I need to help out at the shop today, so I've gotta leave[nl]right away.
RAK/RAK0078280
Huh? Looks like everyone's busy today....[nl]Shuu went home early, so I guess I'm walking home alone today.
MRK/MRK0015290
Come on, Raku dearest![nl]You forgot about me, didn't you?
MRK/MRK0015300
Unlike all the others,[nl]I've got nothing to do whatsoever!
RAK/RAK0078290
Is that something you're proud to say?
@expose
MRK/MRK0015310
I get to walk home with my darling Raku,[nl]so I should be proud!
MRK/MRK0015320
Now then, let's walk home together, okay?
RAK/RAK0078300
Sure, I don't really mind.[nl]Just grab your bag quickly so we can leave.
@ザクシャ万里花・中
MRK/MRK0015330
Ah! I've got some other things I need to get ready,[nl]so please wait at the school gates.
RAK/RAK0078310
Huh? Other things?[nl]And why do I have to wait at the school gate....?
MRK/MRK0015340
Because when you go on an after-school date,[nl]you always meet at the school gates, right?[nl]I've always dreamed of doing something like that with my Raku dearest!
RAK/RAK0078320
A-A date!?[nl]No, I just wanna go home!
MRK/MRK0015350
Just wait by the school gates, please, Raku dearest.[nl]I'll be right there! Ta-ta.
RAK/RAK0078330
She just does not listen at all....
RAK/RAK0078340
It can't be helped.[nl]I'll just wait by the school gate.

RAK/RAK0078350
(....Tachibana's late.[nl] I've been here for, what, 10 minutes already?)
RAK/RAK0078360
(I mean, if I'd just gone home by myself,[nl] I'd have been home by now.)
HND/HND0000700
....It's Master Ichijo.[nl]Are you heading home?
RAK/RAK0078370
Oh, Honda.
RAK/RAK0078380
I'm waiting to meet with Tachibana....[nl]Are you doing the same thing?
HND/HND0000710
Yes, I'm here to pick up the mistress.
RAK/RAK0078390
A-Anyway, you wanna wait together[nl]until Tachibana gets here?
HND/HND0000720
Very well.
RAK/RAK0078400
....Care for a marshmallow?
HND/HND0000730
No, thank you.
RAK/RAK0078410
Ahhhh, yes, of course....
RAK/RAK0078420
U-Um....
HND/HND0000740
What is it?
RAK/RAK0078430
What is it you do while Tachibana's at school, Honda?
HND/HND0000750
I mostly patrol around the school.[nl]I keep an eye out for suspicious persons and objects.
RAK/RAK0078440
A-Ahhh, I see....
RAK/RAK0078450
W-What about your day off?
HND/HND0000760
I organize papers and make the mistress's[nl]protection is up to snuff.
RAK/RAK0078460
Ohh.... You've got quite the work ethic.
RAK/RAK0078470
....Are you thirsty?[nl]Would you like some juice?
HND/HND0000770
No thank you.
RAK/RAK0078480
Okay then....
HND/HND0000780
You are kind, Master Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0078490
Huh?
HND/HND0000790
I can understand why the mistress fell for you.
RAK/RAK0078500
Ahh....
RAK/RAK0078510
(Ghh.... I can't keep this conversation going at all![nl] Isn't there anything we can talk about!?)
RAK/RAK0078520
(That's right, we can talk about our common link: Tachibana!)
RAK/RAK0078530
So, what is it you usually talk about with Tachibana?[nl]I'm kinda curious.
RAK/RAK0078540
(Alright, we should be able to hold a conversation now![nl] Well, how about it!?)
HND/HND0000800
Mostly about you, Master Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0078550
(It's over!?)
RAK/RAK0078560
(Dammit, what's left after that!?[nl] It would be awkward not to say anything after already[nl] trying to half-heartedly make conversation....)
RAK/RAK0078570
(Hurry up and get here, Tachibana![nl] How long are you gonna make me wait like this!?)
MRK/MRK0015360
Raku dearest, thank you so much for waiting!
RAK/RAK0078580
Ohh!
HND/HND0000810
Mistress, welcome back.
MRK/MRK0015370
Oh, if it isn't Honda.[nl]What are you doing here?
HND/HND0000820
I'm here to pick you up.
HND/HND0000830
I understand that you promised to walk home with Master Ichijo,[nl]but may I take you home in the car?
MRK/MRK0015380
Jeez, you just don't get it, Honda.[nl]If we did that, our date at the school gate[nl]would all have been for nothing.
MRK/MRK0015390
Right, Raku dearest? ★
RAK/RAK0078590
Whatever, I was itching to see you[nl]as soon as possible, Tachibana!
MRK/MRK0015400
W-Whaaaat!?[nl]I never thought I'd hear you say those words, Raku dearest....!
RAK/RAK0078600
Yeah.... That was the longest wait of my life![nl]I was waiting and waiting for you to come meet me!
HND/HND0000840
While we were waiting for you, Mistress,[nl]Master Ichijo kept talking about you.
@ザクシャ万里花・大
MRK/MRK0015410
Fwaaaah!?
MRK/MRK0015420
N-No way....[nl]You were waiting that eagerly for me, Raku dearest....![nl]I-I wasn't expecting that at all....
MRK/MRK0015430
I'm feeling lightheaded from excitement....
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0078610
T-Tachibana!?
HND/HND0000850
....Looks like she's fainted.[nl]Let's get her to the car for the time being.
RAK/RAK0078620
Why would she suddenly....
HND/HND0000860
Master Ichijo. I'm sorry for the inconvenience,[nl]but I'm certain the Mistress will wake up soon.[nl]Would you mind waiting in the car with us until then?
RAK/RAK0078630
S-Sure.... That'll be fine.
....
RAK/RAK0078640
(Problem is, now I'm alone with her again....)
RAK/RAK0078650
(Ooogh....[nl] Hurry up and wake up, Tachibana!)
