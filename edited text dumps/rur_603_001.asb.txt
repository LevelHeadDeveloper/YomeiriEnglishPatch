Hahh....hahh....
RAK/RAK0033130
No good....[nl]I don't think we can get seven people's glasses....
SYU/SYU0005390
Hmmm.....that's true.[nl]This isn't so easy.
RAK/RAK0033140
(If we give up now, we'll end up stuck in glasses-world.[nl] But then there's the matter of surviving....)
RAK/RAK0033150
(What should I do? Give up?)
I'm not giving up yet!
Give up and accept this world.
RAK/RAK0033160
No....this world is just not right!
RAK/RAK0033170
We're not giving up. Let's do it all over again!
@ヌキアシリトライ処理
RAK/RAK0033180
No....I just don't have the mental strength[nl]to go any further.
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0033190
Sorry, Shuu. I'm going to accept this world.
SYU/SYU0005400
I see....[nl]Well, this was my fault to begin with, and if[nl]that's your decision, then I won't object to it.
@expose
SYU/SYU0005410
Now that we're here, let's try to live[nl]positively in this world, shall we?
RAK/RAK0033200
Haha....you sure changed gears quickly.
SYU/SYU0005420
Well, sure. I'm sure we'll be fine here.[nl]Well then, let's go tell Ruri about our decision.
@rur_006_202_another
@rur_603_success
SYU/SYU0005430
We managed to get four pairs of glasses.[nl]Counting ours, that's six in total....[nl]Wowww, we sure did a great job!
RAK/RAK0033210
I think I get at least 80% of the credit for that....
SYU/SYU0005440
But it's too early to let our guard down just yet.[nl]We need seven pairs of glasses. The final mega-boss[nl]is waiting for us, just before the sun sets.
RAK/RAK0033220
Final mega-boss?
SYU/SYU0005450
Yes. The person closest to us,[nl]and apparently the most unconquerable....
SYU/SYU0005460
....It's Ruri.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
SYU/SYU0005470
Oh, over there. Ruri!
RAK/RAK0033230
(Miyamoto....[nl] She's wearing a swimsuit,[nl] but she's also wearing glasses....)
RUR/RUR0005880
You guys....[nl]Have you finished getting glasses?
SYU/SYU0005480
Mostly. There's just one small thing left.
RUR/RUR0005890
Hmmmm, good work....
RUR/RUR0005900
Well? Since you're both here,[nl]how about you go swimming, too?
RAK/RAK0033240
Sorry, we don't have time for that.[nl]It's almost sunset.
RAK/RAK0033250
So we're here for the last pair of glasses.
RUR/RUR0005910
Hmmm.....I see.
........
RAK/RAK0033260
Hey, Miyamoto, you know what I'm talking about, right?
RUR/RUR0005920
What is it?
RAK/RAK0033270
That last pair of glasses is yours.
RUR/RUR0005930
It doesn't have to be mine.
RUR/RUR0005940
There are other people close to you, right?[nl]....For example, your family.
@expose
SYU/SYU0005490
We don't have time to go home.[nl]Besides....
SYU/SYU0005500
The only person that's close to *all three of us*[nl]is you, Ruri. You're the only one that fits the bill.
RAK/RAK0033280
So please, Miyamoto. Take off your glasses.[nl]That way we can be out of here as---
RUR/RUR0005950
I don't want to.
RAK/RAK0033290
Huh?
RUR/RUR0005960
Didn't you hear me?[nl]I said I don't want to.
RAK/RAK0033300
W-Why not, Miyamoto!?[nl]If you don't take off your glasses,[nl]the world's not gonna go back to normal!
RAK/RAK0033310
You said yourself that it was too crazy here!
RUR/RUR0005970
Indeed. It's not normal at all.[nl]I think it's absurd to live in a world where everyone[nl]has to wear glasses.
RUR/RUR0005980
But, more importantly, I don't[nl]want to take off my glasses in front of you guys.
SYU/SYU0005510
Does that mean you're embarrassed?
RUR/RUR0005990
Yes, that is correct.
RUR/RUR0006000
I know in my head that it's silly to feel that way.[nl]But what use is there in trying not[nl]to be embarrassed?
RAK/RAK0033320
No way....[nl]Even Onodera trusted me and gave me her glasses....
RUR/RUR0006010
Kosaki is Kosaki. I'm me.[nl]I have no obligation to show you guys my true face.
RUR/RUR0006020
I'd rather live and die in this glasses-world[nl]than do something so embarrassing. There aren't any[nl]downsides to living a normal life here for me.
RAK/RAK0033330
----
RAK/RAK0033340
So you don't intend to return to the original world!?
RUR/RUR0006030
You'd prefer this world too, wouldn't you, Maiko?[nl]You've been making so much noise about girls with glasses.
RUR/RUR0006040
Isn't this place basically your ideal world, in a sense?
SYU/SYU0005520
Hmmmm. You raise a good point....
RAK/RAK0033350
No, wait, Shuu.[nl]Don't listen to her.
RAK/RAK0033360
Because of us, everyone's views on glasses have[nl]gone awry. So it's up to us to bring them back to normal!
RUR/RUR0006050
I wouldn't necessarily say....that it's gone awry.
RAK/RAK0033370
What do you mean?
RUR/RUR0006060
Clothing values change so easily. There was a time when it[nl]was fine to live in a hole with only a loincloth, and there was[nl]a time when everyone had to wear suits on crowded trains.
RUR/RUR0006070
Neither one is particularly correct, right?
RUR/RUR0006080
It's the same either way, glasses or no glasses.[nl]In the end, you'll get used to it, and it won't[nl]matter whether it's right or wrong.
SYU/SYU0005530
Haha....this is philosophy....
RAK/RAK0033380
Shuu!
SYU/SYU0005540
But you're just using sophistry[nl]to hide your embarrassment.
RUR/RUR0006090
!!
RUR/RUR0006100
....I am. Is there a problem?
RUR/RUR0006110
Anyway, I'll never take off my glasses.
RAK/RAK0033390
........
RUR/RUR0006120
Get out of my way.[nl]I'm going to go change.
RAK/RAK0033400
....Dammit! She really is unconquerable![nl]We're running out of time, what do we do!?
SYU/SYU0005550
....Hey, Raku.
RAK/RAK0033410
What?
SYU/SYU0005560
I was just thinking....
@expose2
SYU/SYU0005570
It might actually not be a bad idea[nl]to live in this glasses-world, like Ruri said?
SYU/SYU0005580
It is a paradise in a way, though it's not as interesting[nl]since all the girls are wearing glasses.
RAK/RAK0033420
Hey, hey, what kind of joke....
@expose
SYU/SYU0005590
I didn't mean it as a joke.[nl]I'm just saying, we could.
Sure, I guess we could.
No, we can't!
RAK/RAK0033430
(Really!? Am I really sure about that!?)
Yes!
No, I'm not at all!
......
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0033440
Actually....even if we are feeling uncomfortable now,[nl]it might just be a matter of getting used to it....
RAK/RAK0033450
I don't think it's right to force Miyamoto to[nl]take off her glasses when she doesn't want to.
SYU/SYU0005600
Right? There's no inconvenience except for the glasses,[nl]so let's enjoy the rest of our lives with glasses.
RAK/RAK0033460
Alright, let's do it.[nl]Starting tomorrow, we'll be living in[nl]harmony with everyone else.
SYU/SYU0005610
Well, Raku, don't forget to wear your glasses tomorrow.[nl]In this world, not wearing glasses could be[nl]considered indecent exposure.
RAK/RAK0033470
I know.
RAK/RAK0033480
You've always worn glasses, so you don't need to worry.[nl]I envy you.
RUR/RUR0006130
....Sounds like you've gotten your story straight.
RAK/RAK0033490
Miyamoto!?
RUR/RUR0006140
Thank goodness.[nl]It would seem you were convinced after all.
RAK/RAK0033500
Yeah. Starting tomorrow, I'll be[nl]one of 1-C's four-eyeses.
RAK/RAK0033510
Happy to be here, four-eyeses!
SYU/SYU0005620
Well, we're not really the "four-eyeses" anymore[nl]now that all our classmates wear glasses.
RUR/RUR0006150
Well, duh, the whole world's wearing glasses.
RAK/RAK0033520G
Hahahahaha!
@rur_006_202_another
RAK/RAK0033530
No, that's not how this works. This is an unusual situation[nl]that was caused by our irresponsibility. We can't just[nl]turn a blind eye and run away from it.
RAK/RAK0033540
It's in my family's "Hundred Articles of Manhood".[nl]"You gotta wipe your own ass," it says.
SYU/SYU0005640
Ooooh....what a cool line, Raku.[nl]If I was a woman, I might have just fallen in love with you.
RAK/RAK0033550
Hey, don't be creepy.[nl]Onodera almost misunderstood earlier.
SYU/SYU0005650
Hahaha....[nl]Well, what you said is true.
SYU/SYU0005660
As anticipated, I have seen enough[nl]girls with glasses for one day.
RAK/RAK0033560
Yeah. I'm gonna beg Miyamoto and try to[nl]get her to take off her glasses.
RUR/RUR0006170
....That's not going to happen.
RAK/RAK0033570
!![nl]Miyamoto!
SYU/SYU0005670
You're done changing, Ruri.[nl]While you're at it, take off the glasses as well as the swimsuit.
RUR/RUR0006180
I already told you I don't want to.[nl]How many times do I have to repeat myself?
RUR/RUR0006190
Besides, if you ask me,[nl]there's no need to undo any of this.
RUR/RUR0006200
Glasses are wonderful.[nl]All humankind gets glasses. This is not bad.
RAK/RAK0033580
Dammit, you really aren't taking them off, are you....
RUR/RUR0006210
I'm saying that the idea that you should be taking them off[nl]and putting them back on is wrong. If you want, I can tell[nl]you what I mean. I'll tell you how good glasses are.
RUR/RUR0006220
And I'll take my time, so that we can[nl]stay in this world for the rest of our lives.
SYU/SYU0005680
I see. So you want to settle this through discussion.[nl]In that case, I accept your challenge!
SYU/SYU0005690
....on Raku's behalf!
RAK/RAK0033590
Why me!?
SYU/SYU0005700
I keep telling you, you're the negotiator, right?
SYU/SYU0005710
Besides, talking to Ruri makes me feel like[nl]living in a world where everyone wears glasses[nl]might not be so bad.
RAK/RAK0033600
You're useless....!
RUR/RUR0006230
I don't care either way.[nl]I doubt I will be out-reasoned.
RAK/RAK0033610
It can't be helped. I'll do it.
RAK/RAK0033620
Miyamoto! I'll prove that your defense of glasses[nl]is just a cop-out!
RUR/RUR0006240
Hmph....show me what you got.
