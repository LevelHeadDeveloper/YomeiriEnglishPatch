Honestly, you're so reliable, Ichijo.[nl]Right, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0015530
Yeah! Thanks for your help today.
KSM/KSM0000100
....Oh, that's right! It's getting late,[nl]so why don't you have dinner here.
RAK/RAK0050870
Huh....? I-Is that okay?
KSM/KSM0000110

KSK/KSK0015550
Uh....but Ichijo, are you sure you wouldn't[nl]have to cook dinner for your family?
RAK/RAK0050880
Yeah, I knew I'd be here a bit late,[nl]so I asked the guys at home to do it.
KSK/KSK0015560
Well, it's fine then. Right?[nl]Then let's have dinner together.
RAK/RAK0050890
Y-Yeah....! I'd be happy to!
KSM/KSM0000130
Alright, Kosaki, I'm going to cook dinner,[nl]so can you keep Ichijo company until it's ready?

Oh, do you want me to help?
KSM/KSM0000140
My, you are quite the considerate young man!
KSM/KSM0000150
