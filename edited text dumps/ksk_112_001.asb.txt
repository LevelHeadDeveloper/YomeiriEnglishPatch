Looks like Chitoge's late....[nl]Let's just start feeding the animals now.
DOG/DOG0000030
Grrr....woof, woof!
SNK/SNK0000180
Hissss! Hisss!
RAK/RAK0047220
....Hmm?[nl]The animals are getting all hopped up, could it be....!

KSK/KSK0012780
Hello, everyone![nl]You all look great today!
RAK/RAK0047230
(It's Onodera---!)
KSK/KSK0012790
Ichijo, is it alright if I help you with the animals?[nl]Chitoge asked me to help you....
RAK/RAK0047240
Sure, thanks a bunch![nl]Chitoge can't come, then?
KSK/KSK0012800
Yeah, she had to go home all of a sudden.
RAK/RAK0047250
I see. Sorry, Onodera.
@expose
KSK/KSK0012810
No, don't worry about it.[nl]So, what should I help you with first?
RAK/RAK0047260
Ummmmm.....[nl]Well, how about we start by getting everyone fed?
KSK/KSK0012820
Yeah, alright![nl]Dinnertime, everyone~!
IBR/IBR0000020
Grunt, grunt!
RAK/RAK0047270
Ooh, they ran right for you....![nl]....They're a lot more excited than when [nl]I'm the one feeding them.
KSK/KSK0012830
Hahaha, that's not true.[nl]They've spent a lot more time with you than I have,[nl]so I'm sure they think of you as family.
KSK/KSK0012840
See, when you're their family, it's normal for them to[nl]be around you, and it's normal for you to feed them....[nl]It's kinda like that.
RAK/RAK0047280
Well, I guess that's fine....[nl]But I don't see how it could be true.
KSK/KSK0012850
If I were an animal, I would love someone like you who[nl]works hard to take care of me.
RAK/RAK0047290
(O-Onodera loves me!?[nl] No, that's just hypothetical, right? Yeah.)
RAK/RAK0047300
(....If Onodera was an animal,[nl] I'd probably do my best taking care of her....)
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0047310
Well, we'll do some cleaning next.[nl]Onodera, you take that half. [nl]Let me know if you need anything.
KSK/KSK0012860
Sure!
RAK/RAK0047320
(Onodera's really family-oriented....[nl] She's clever, hardworking, and kind....)
RAK/RAK0047330
Hahh....I wish we could live together....
KSK/KSK0012870
Yeah.
RAK/RAK0047340
Eeeeeeeeeeeh!?!?!?!?
KSK/KSK0012880
I do live in a Japanese sweet shop....[nl]But it would be kind of fun to have a pet.
RAK/RAK0047350
Y-Yeah~, I see.[nl]That's what you meant, hahaha, ha.
KSK/KSK0012890
?
RAK/RAK0047360
(Did I accidentally say that out loud?[nl] Dang it....I almost confessed my feelings.)
RAK/RAK0047370
Onodera, thanks for your help today.[nl]You've been a big help.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0012900
No problem, I like animals too.
KSK/KSK0012910
Give me a call if you need my help again.
RAK/RAK0047380
Okay.
