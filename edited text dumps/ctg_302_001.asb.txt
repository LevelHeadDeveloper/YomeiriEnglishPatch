Alright, I think that's enough for today's date.[nl]Let's head home.
CTG/CTG0021510
Huh....? We're going home already?[nl]It's been less than an hour since we met up.
RAK/RAK0073280
Unlike I thought, Claude and the others aren't[nl]watching today. Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend[nl]a day like this on our own, however we wanted?
RAK/RAK0073300
Or is there something else you wanted to do?
@expose
CTG/CTG0021520
No, not really....[nl]I don't have anything in particular I wanted to do.
CTG/CTG0021530
....W-Well then, let's talk about our next date![nl]We could go someplace we've never been before,[nl]why don't we!?
RAK/RAK0073310
Let's see. I've got an informational magazine,[nl]so I'll think about it.
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0021540
Isn't that the one I gave you?[nl]Hmmmm, at least you read it.
RAK/RAK0073320
More or less, at least.
CTG/CTG0021550
Even so, today's date felt kinda sloppy.
RAK/RAK0073330
A plan is just a plan.[nl]It doesn't mean it'll be carried out to the letter.
CTG/CTG0021560
....You just didn't make one in the first place, did you.
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0073340
We talked a lot about it, but....[nl]we didn't end up deciding anything.
CTG/CTG0021570
Yeah. It's pretty late in the evening now,[nl]and I'm kinda hungry.
RAK/RAK0073350
Do you wanna buy some food?[nl]How about some of the ningyoyaki over there?
CTG/CTG0021580
Ningyoyaki?[nl]They actually bake dolls?[nl]#fs{12}TN: Ningyoyaki literally translates to "baked dolls".#fs{}
RAK/RAK0073360
Ah....so you don't know.
RAK/RAK0073380
Hang on a sec.
RAK/RAK0073390
Excuse me. One, please. Custard flavor.
RAK/RAK0073400
Here. This is a ningyoyaki.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0021600
Oooh, it really does look like a doll.[nl]It's soft and crumbly.... Is this a pancake!?
RAK/RAK0073410
Well, sort of.
RAK/RAK0073420
These are typically filled with red bean paste,[nl]but you like custard, so I got you a custard one.
CTG/CTG0021630
Nom.
CTG/CTG0021640
Mmm! It's so warm and delicious!
RAK/RAK0073440
That's good.
CTG/CTG0021650
Oh, right! Wait just a second!
CTG/CTG0021660
Here ya go. This one's yours!
RAK/RAK0073450
Huh!? You're treating me?[nl]That's unusual.
CTG/CTG0021670
It's not a treat, it's splitting the bill.[nl]You bought me mine, after all.
RAK/RAK0073460
And it's the red bean paste kind.[nl]Thanks, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0021680
....Nom.
CTG/CTG0021690
Mhm, it's pretty fun to grab a bite out occasionally.
RAK/RAK0073470
....Hey, Chitoge, I was thinking,[nl]maybe for one of our next scheduled dates,[nl]we could go on, like, a food tour?
CTG/CTG0021700
A food tour, huh....[nl]I was hoping for something a tad more romantic....
CTG/CTG0021710
Well, whatever.[nl]Sounds fun, let's do it!
RAK/RAK0073480
Sounds good to me. [nl]Alright, so what kinds of places haven't you been,[nl]for example?
CTG/CTG0021720
For example....!?[nl]Let's see....ummmm....for exaaaample....
CTG/CTG0021730
Like overseas!?
RAK/RAK0073490
Huh!? Overseasss!?
CTG/CTG0021740
O-Oh. Bad idea?
RAK/RAK0073500
No, it's not that it was a bad idea....[nl]It's just that we can't make that a day trip,[nl]and we don't need to go that far.
CTG/CTG0021750
Okay, what about you?[nl]Where do you want to go?
RAK/RAK0073510
I'm fine with anywhere.[nl]All that matters is that we go on our scheduled dates.
CTG/CTG0021760

RAK/RAK0073520
...Hm? Why do you look so discontented?
CTG/CTG0021770
....You really don't get it, do you....
RAK/RAK0073530
Don't get what?
CTG/CTG0021780
I mean, our date today didn't feel like a real date at all![nl]You could stand to do more boyfriendy things!
RAK/RAK0073540
Boyfriendy things? Well, but....[nl]You really want me to do that?
@expose2
CTG/CTG0021790
I-I-I don't....![nl]But, well....since it's a date and all, it'd certainly be nice!
CTG/CTG0021800
....Well, I guess I shouldn't have expected that from you.[nl]Sorry, never mind! Don't even worry about it now.
RAK/RAK0073550
(Her expectations for me are that low....?)
