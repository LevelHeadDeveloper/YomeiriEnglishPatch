Fwah....I couldn't get Raku dearest[nl]to notice me today, either.
MRK/MRK0006310
With just one really big push,[nl]I feel like I could get him to love me[nl]more than Kirisaki.....
ANA/ANA0000010
Yes, and for our next topic~,[nl]this hot-topic top idol and the news[nl]of her sudden marriage registration!
MRK/MRK0006320
Hm?
@expose
ANA/ANA0000020
And folks, the man she's marrying is[nl]none other than her own manager!
ANA/ANA0000030
Why would this wildly successful top idol,[nl]who won first place in the last election,[nl]marry her manager?
ANA/ANA0000040
We'll be right back once[nl]we have more information!
MRK/MRK0006330
Honda.
HND/HND0000090
What is it?
MRK/MRK0006340
Is it really such a surprise[nl]that this idol is getting married?
HND/HND0000100
Since she's such a talented and popular idol,[nl]most of the uproar is from her unusually[nl]large fanbase.
MRK/MRK0006350
But, why would she get married so suddenly?
HND/HND0000110
I'm not sure about the specifics....[nl]But the main reason seems to be[nl]that she won the top position in the election.
HND/HND0000120
There's a rumor circulating that her manager[nl]fell in love with her for her earnest efforts[nl]and straightforwardness in her pursuit of Top Idol.
MRK/MRK0006360
Hmmm.....I'm jealous.
MRK/MRK0006370
I wish I could have an affair[nl]like that with Raku dearest....
ANA/ANA0000050
On our next segment....this week's Doki-Doki Power Spot![nl]And here it is, a shrine.....
MRK/MRK0006380
Huh? That's....
HND/HND0000130
That little shrine in Mr. Ichijo's town.
ANA/ANA0000060
These last few years, anyone who visits this shrine,[nl]one after another, had their love fulfilled, they say![nl]Now, it's a romance hot spot!
ANA/ANA0000070
We don't yet know if the idol from before had prayed[nl]at this shrine yet, but nevertheless, this spot[nl]is rapidly gaining popularity!
MRK/MRK0006390
Fulfilled love....I see.
HND/HND0000140
Mistress?
MRK/MRK0006400
Whatever it takes, be it god, or straw....
MRK/MRK0006410
Honda, bring the car around.
HND/HND0000150
....Very well.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
MRK/MRK0006420
I will try everything I can[nl]to be with Raku dearest!
MRK/MRK0006430
For ten years, I've been molding[nl]myself into the perfect girl for him.[nl]I won't let that go to waste!
MRK/MRK0006440
Dear God, dear Buddha, dear Raku! Hear my prayer!
MRK/MRK0006450
Please let me....[nl]Give me a great love story like that idol....!
MRK/MRK0006460
Please, just this one thing![nl]Let me be in love like her!
@キャラ揺らし
MRK/MRK0006470

MRK/MRK0006500
Pheww.....I feel like with this much effort,[nl]my prayer should work at least a little.
MRK/MRK0006510
Well, I'm going home.
OTM/OTM0001720
Mrgggh....what a raucous way of making a wish.[nl]Puny boneheaded mortal....

RAK/RAK0025180
What's the matter, Tachibana?[nl]Didn't get enough sleep?
MRK/MRK0006530
Yeah.....I paid a visit too late at night.
CTG/CTG0009430
Paid a visit? Where to?
MRK/MRK0006540
It's unrelated to you, Kirisaki.
SSR/SSR0009680
Hey, Marika Tachibana.[nl]The mistress just asked you a question,[nl]so why don't you just answer plainly?
MRK/MRK0006550
I refuse.
MRK/MRK0006560
But, since Onodera and Miyamoto are my friends,[nl]I will tell them.
MRK/MRK0006570
Well then, please come over here.
KSK/KSK0007680
Huh!? H-How come we're the only ones?
CTG/CTG0009440
It's fine, you two.[nl]I'm not really interested in what she has to say.
RAK/RAK0025190
Try to get along.
CTG/CTG0009450
Well, whose fault do you think this is?
RAK/RAK0025200
Is it mine!?
SYU/SYU0001740
Marika, what about me?[nl]I'm your friend, right?
MRK/MRK0006580
No, you are not.
SYU/SYU0001750
Cold as ever, I see--.[nl]Well, it has something to do with Raku, right?
MRK/MRK0006590
Of course it does.[nl]But, it's a secret from him, okay?
RAK/RAK0025210
Then wouldn't it make more sense to talk about it[nl]sometime when I'm not around....?

You, you there![nl]Do you have a moment?
MRK/MRK0006600
Me?

Yes! You!
PRO/PRO0000050
You have the potential to be the nations's....[nl]No, the world's hottest new idol!
PRO/PRO0000060
Are you willing to join our agency[nl]and participate in the nationwide idol election[nl]in three month's time?
CTG/CTG0009460
Marika....
RAK/RAK0025240
An idol!?
MRK/MRK0006610
Well....
PRO/PRO0000070
I know a top idol when I see one![nl]Please, join our office!
RAK/RAK0025250
(Idolship, huh.....[nl]I don't think she'd be interested in that.)
CTG/CTG0009470
Hang on, Marika! This is amazing!
CTG/CTG0009480
It's not every day you get a chance like this![nl]You should definitely do it!
RAK/RAK0025260
(Huh.....?[nl] Chitoge, what are you saying?)
SSR/SSR0009690
It's true....[nl]Your appearance is very cute and girly.
KSK/KSK0007690
Ehehe.....if I was friends with an idol,[nl]I could brag to everyone.
RAK/RAK0025270
(Tsugumi!? And Onodera, too....[nl] What the hell is going on!?)
RUR/RUR0001020
Celebrity location bento boxes....[nl]I'd like to try one sometime.
SYU/SYU0001760
I'd like you to introduce me to your idol friends![nl]And have them sign autographs!
RAK/RAK0025280
(Huh, you two as well!?)
RAK/RAK0025290
H-Hey, guys, something's weird![nl]Don't you usually think about these things a bit more?
RAK/RAK0025300
Besides, Tachibana hasn't even said she'd do it yet.
MRK/MRK0006620
I'll do it! I'll be an idol!
RAK/RAK0025310
Aaaaahh!
CTG/CTG0009490
What the hell, Raku![nl]You're gonna try to trample[nl]her once-in-a-lifetime chance?
RAK/RAK0025320
No, that's not....
RAK/RAK0025330
Y-You're serious, Tachibana!?
MRK/MRK0006630
Yes. This is the perfect chance!
PRO/PRO0000080
Yes, then we have a deal!
RAK/RAK0025340
Hahhh.....[nl]I really didn't expect you[nl]to accept something like this.
MRK/MRK0006640
Really? I don't think it's that unusual[nl]for a girl to want to be a cute idol.
MRK/MRK0006650
Is that so weird of me?
RAK/RAK0025350
(It's not just you, but there's something[nl]weird about Chitoge and the others as well...)
MRK/MRK0006660
However, I highly doubt it would be manageable[nl]to become a top idol by myself....
MRK/MRK0006670
Therefore, I will have[nl]Raku dearest as my manager.
RAK/RAK0025360
.....What?
MRK/MRK0006680
Having a manager is an absolute[nl]requirement for an idol.
RAK/RAK0025370
Hey....why are you trying[nl]to get me involved in this now?
PRO/PRO0000090
Alright~, that makes it easy.
PRO/PRO0000100
Congratulations, young man.[nl]You're her manager from now on.
RAK/RAK0025380
Huh!? Have you decided that already!?[nl]But I haven't even said anything....
PRO/PRO0000110
Now, let's get busy! Marika, was it?[nl]Hop in the car!
PRO/PRO0000120
You too, manager!
RAK/RAK0025390
Don't I get a say in this!?
CTG/CTG0009500
Good luck, darling.
SSR/SSR0009700
Don't drag your feet, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0025400
R-Really....you guys aren't trying to stop us?
KSK/KSK0007700
Ichijo, I'm sure you'll make a great manager!
RAK/RAK0025410
Huh!? You too, Onodera!?
SYU/SYU0001770
Try and get some[nl]cute idols' email addresses for me, Raku!
RAK/RAK0025420
Why are you worried about that!?
MRK/MRK0006690
Let's go and finish this quickly, manager.
PRO/PRO0000130
We don't have much time before the election![nl]Let's go, manager!

Mr. Ichijo.

Waaahhhh! H-Honda!
RAK/RAK0025470
(As usual, she just appears out of nowhere.[nl] It's bad for my heart.)
HND/HND0000170
We have prepared a suit for you.[nl]Please wear it during business hours.
RAK/RAK0025480
Hahh, thanks.[nl]....I mean, is this okay?
RAK/RAK0025490
After all, Tachibana says she's gonna[nl]be an idol and she doesn't even consult her father.
HND/HND0000180
I spoke with the commissioner already,[nl]so there's no problem.
HND/HND0000190
As long as you're here,[nl]we'll leave the rest to you.
RAK/RAK0025500
I think you're still pretty important here.
HND/HND0000200
Please understand that your[nl]role is very important as well.
RAK/RAK0025510
....U-Understood.
RAK/RAK0025520
(Dammit....why did this happen?)
RAK/RAK0025530
(I think it's a bit weird that everyone's[nl] just rolling with the idea of Tachibana being an idol.)
RAK/RAK0025540
(Something seems off.)
HND/HND0000210
The mistress's costume fitting will be finished shortly,[nl]so please wait for a second.
RAK/RAK0025550
You have a costume already?[nl]How'd you find one in her size so fast?
PRO/PRO0000140
Well, you remember that one idol who[nl]quit the other day because she got married?
RAK/RAK0025560
Ah, yes, that was in the news.[nl]Um, if I remember correctly, it was right in the middle of-
PRO/PRO0000150
Yes, yes. Anyway, her old costume was[nl]just the right size for Tachibana![nl]We'll use that for the time being.
RAK/RAK0025570
Well, that's convenient, I guess.
PRO/PRO0000160
This must be a sign from the gods,[nl]they want Tachibana to stay on the path of idolship....
RAK/RAK0025580
(Gods, huh.....[nl] Somehow, I feel weird about that....)
MRK/MRK0006700
Raku dearest.
@背景変更2
RAK/RAK0025590
....Whoa!
MRK/MRK0006710
Um, what's the matter?
RAK/RAK0025600
Eh---?
MRK/MRK0006720
Do you think it suits me?
RAK/RAK0025610
Ah, um, yes.[nl]Is it....bad that I think so?
RAK/RAK0025620
(It looks so good at her that I had to stop and[nl] look for a second....but I won't tell her that.)
PRO/PRO0000170
Hey, hey, manager.
PRO/PRO0000180
This is the part where you praise her.[nl]Y'know, compliments. Motivation. Boost her ego.
RAK/RAK0025630
Oh, is that how it's done?
PRO/PRO0000190
That's the job of all the top-class managers:[nl]First and foremost, keep the girls motivated!
RAK/RAK0025640
(I really don't want to be a manager at all.)
PRO/PRO0000200
Alright, Honda and I will be in a meeting[nl]discussing your future, and you and Marika[nl]can talk for a while. All good.
RAK/RAK0025650
Hahh.....
MRK/MRK0006730
Talking with Raku dearest is always welcome.
RAK/RAK0025660
(Am I.....really okay[nl] with being a manager here?)
Let's play along for a bit.
Sorry, no
RAK/RAK0025670
(Tachibana, Chitoge and everyone are acting weird....[nl] Maybe I should stick around and find out why.)
OTM/OTM0001750
Mwehehehe.....how art thou, Manager?
RAK/RAK0025680
Tachibana....
MRK/MRK0006740
Yes?
RAK/RAK0025690
I'm sorry!
MRK/MRK0006750
Huh?
RAK/RAK0025700
I know we've gotten this far already, but....[nl]I don't want to be your manager.
RAK/RAK0025710
Don't get me wrong, I want to support you,[nl]but I also want to be a normal high school student....
RAK/RAK0025720
I can't imagine I'm much help to[nl]you with my half-hearted....wait, that's just an excuse.[nl]Uhh~, well, I don't know how to say this....
MRK/MRK0006760
.....Understood.
MRK/MRK0006770
If you say so, Raku dearest,[nl]then I can't stop you.
RAK/RAK0025730
MRK/MRK0006780
It's really too bad....[nl]But I don't want to do anything to make[nl]my darling Raku unhappy.
MRK/MRK0006790
I will tell my father and Honda.[nl]Don't worry about anything else,[nl]just go home.
RAK/RAK0025740
Okay....[nl]Sorry, Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0006800
Please don't look at me like that.[nl]It was me who roped you into this.
MRK/MRK0006810
Well, Raku dearest, I'll see you at school.[nl]I may not be able to be there as much these days....
MRK/MRK0006820
Please do support me, however,[nl]now that I'm an idol.
RAK/RAK0025750
Yes, of course.[nl]We'll all support you, so do your best.
MRK/MRK0006830
Okay....
RAK/RAK0025760
See ya.
RAK/RAK0025770
(Sorry, Tachibana....[nl] But I want to be a civil servant in the future.)
RAK/RAK0025780
(So it would be best if I[nl] didn't get caught up in a weird situation[nl] like this one.)
RAK/RAK0025790
....What?
MRK/MRK0006840
Hm? Did you forget something?
RAK/RAK0025800
No....that's not it.[nl]That was weird.
RAK/RAK0025810
Sorry. See ya round,[nl]for real this time, Tachibana!
RAK/RAK0025820
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0025830
W-What the hell....[nl]I opened the door to leave,[nl]didn't I!?
MRK/MRK0006850
Raku dearest? What's the matter?
RAK/RAK0025840
(W-What's going on?[nl] I can't leave this room!
OTM/OTM0001760
Shall I tell thee why not?
MRK/MRK0006860
Huh?
RAK/RAK0025850
O-Otama!
MRK/MRK0006870
Otama? Raku dearest, do you know her?
RAK/RAK0025860
Huh? Ah~, well....[nl]Maybe I kinda know her....
OTM/OTM0001770
A-hem. I am a goddess of divine grace, an "Inari-sama".[nl]This young lady's journey towards her dream hath[nl]gotten off to a good start.
MRK/MRK0006880
Huh? Inari....sama?
RAK/RAK0025870
Aahahaha....don't worry, Tachibana![nl]She's one of my cousins, but she gets a little[nl]delusional like this sometimes....
@expose
OTM/OTM0001780
Huh!? What dost thou mean, I'm delusional!?[nl]I cannot let that remark slide!
RAK/RAK0025880
Forget it![nl]We're in a bit of a difficult situation right now![nl]Please try not to complicate it further!
MRK/MRK0006890
Oh, so it was you![nl]Thank you very much for doing this.
RAK/RAK0025890
Eh?
OTM/OTM0001790
Mhm. Thy demeanor is most pleasing.
RAK/RAK0025900
Wa-W-What? What did you say?[nl]I don't know what you're talking about.
MRK/MRK0006900
I went to the shrine last night to make a wish.[nl]And this Inari-sama heard it and granted it.
OTM/OTM0001800
Oh my, thou art a very quick-witted young lady.[nl]Usually, it takes a few tries to get[nl]people to believe I'm a goddess.
MRK/MRK0006910
I'm sure it does.
MRK/MRK0006920
But what really tipped me off is that[nl]I conveniently got scouted out the morning[nl]after I made my wish.
MRK/MRK0006930
The only reasonable explanation for that was[nl]that some kind of supernatural force was pulling strings.
OTM/OTM0001810
I see. Thou art quite a quite rational maiden.[nl]Thy understanding surprises me.
RAK/RAK0025910
Uh, um, I'm still not sure[nl]what you're talking about.
OTM/OTM0001820
Thou doth not understand still,[nl]even after all this discourse?[nl]Thy lack of understanding surprises me.
OTM/OTM0001830
Basically, thou art in this situation[nl]because I granted her wish.
RAK/RAK0025920
Huh!? So all this was your doing!?
OTM/OTM0001840
Yes, but such praise isn't necessary.[nl]I was simply doing my duty as a fox goddess.
RAK/RAK0025930
That wasn't praise!
OTM/OTM0001850
By granting wishes, I accumulate virtue.[nl]And with this virtue, I can rise to the level[nl]of the grandest fox goddess.
OTM/OTM0001860
In a way, this was training for me.[nl]Therefore, young lady, I would like to thank thee.
RAK/RAK0025940
Hey, listen to me!
OTM/OTM0001870
Blah, blah, blah, shut up.[nl]What the heck dost thou want?
RAK/RAK0025950
If this is something you did,[nl]can't you just undo it?
OTM/OTM0001880
So, thou wouldst have me cancel a wish?
OTM/OTM0001890
What an awful thing to wish for.[nl]Thou wouldst trample on this young lady's wish?
RAK/RAK0025960
W-Well....
RAK/RAK0025970
I mean, Tachibana,[nl]why do you want to be an idol in the first place?
MRK/MRK0006940
It's not that I particularly want to be an idol.
RAK/RAK0025980
OTM/OTM0001900
That's right.[nl]Becoming an idol is merely a step on the way.[nl]Her true goal is beyond that.
OTM/OTM0001910
First things first, Raku.[nl]If thou doth not make her an idol,[nl]thou canst not leave this place, got that?
OTM/OTM0001920
Having thee as manager is part of the wish.
MRK/MRK0006950
Raku dearest, it will only be for a short while.[nl]Please indulge my selfishness for that time.
RAK/RAK0026000
W-Well, I guess...
OTM/OTM0001940
Give up and go along with her wish.
OTM/OTM0001950
Just do it! I'm happy,[nl]thou art happy, she is also happy![nl]It's a win-win-win situation!
RAK/RAK0026010
(Where did you hear that phrase....)
RAK/RAK0026020
Alright, fine.[nl]I still don't know exactly what's going on....[nl]But if Tachibana makes top idol, then we're free, right?
RAK/RAK0026030
Tachibana. I'm going to make you a top idol!
RAK/RAK0026040
Crap.[nl]I still don't know exactly what's going on....[nl]But if Tachibana makes top idol, then we're free, right?
RAK/RAK0026050
Alright, Tachibana! I'll do it![nl]I'm going to make you a top idol!
MRK/MRK0006960
Really!?
RAK/RAK0026060
Yeah. If it'll help you[nl]fulfill your ambitions, I'll do it!
RAK/RAK0026070
(And I'll also get out of[nl] this ridiculous situation!)
MRK/MRK0006970
Raku dearest....[nl]Thank you!
MRK/MRK0006980
You can count on me![nl]I'll surely become a lovely young lady[nl]that my darling Raku can be proud of!

HND/HND0000240
Please be there.
RAK/RAK0026190
....Ghh....fine.
RAK/RAK0026200
Ryuu. I don't think I'll be able[nl]to cook the meals for a while.[nl]Do you think you can handle that?
RYU/RYU0000720
Certainly, young master! Good luck~.
MRK/MRK0006990
I'm back!
RAK/RAK0026210
Phew....between filming the segment,[nl]and the three radio guest appearances,[nl]not to mention the event meetings....
RAK/RAK0026220
Even though you didn't debut too long ago,[nl]you've been very busy.
HND/HND0000250
Mistress Marika, Mr. Ichijo, thank you for your hard work.
HND/HND0000260
Now then, regarding our next move--
RAK/RAK0026230
Huh!? You mean there's more!?
HND/HND0000270
No, today's work is finished.
HND/HND0000280
However, Marika needs to take a few more lessons[nl]for her debut song, which will release next week.
RAK/RAK0026240
A debut song....isn't it a bit soon for that?
PRO/PRO0000210
We have composers lining up around[nl]the block to provide music for Marika.
RAK/RAK0026250
Is that so....[nl]Really, there's no time to rest....
MRK/MRK0007000
But at least I get to be with[nl]my beloved Raku all the time~!
RAK/RAK0026260
Hey! Don't hug me so casually!
RAK/RAK0026270
You never know who has their eyes where.[nl]I want to avoid a scandal.
MRK/MRK0007010
Oh, my....[nl]That's a very professional managerial statement.
MRK/MRK0007020
But as for me, I'm happy and sad....
MRK/MRK0007030
--I mean, I'm sad![nl]I want to be closer to my darling Raku!
RAK/RAK0026280
More importantly,[nl]are you holding up okay?
MRK/MRK0007040
Yes, why?
RAK/RAK0026290
You've got a long work schedule, and if[nl]you take lessons on top of that, you won't have[nl]any time left to sleep, will you?
MRK/MRK0007050
There's not much time until the general election.
RAK/RAK0026300
Don't be so impatient.[nl]There's no way you can really make[nl]the top in just three months, right?
MRK/MRK0007060
You never know until you try.
MRK/MRK0007070
Besides that, I've been[nl]this reckless for the past ten years....
RAK/RAK0026310
But doesn't that mean....[nl]If your body gives out now,[nl]it would be pretty bad, right?
MRK/MRK0007080
As long as you're by my side, Raku dearest,[nl]I won't give out.
RAK/RAK0026320
That's not an answer.
MRK/MRK0007090
....It just that I don't want to regret this.
RAK/RAK0026330
Regret?
MRK/MRK0007100
Even I don't expect everything to[nl]turn out the way I want it to.
MRK/MRK0007110
But....even if I don't make top idol,[nl]I still want to try my very hardest!
RAK/RAK0026340
RAK/RAK0026350
(I can't believe she thought that far ahead....)
MRK/MRK0007120
Well, that's more or less the answer[nl]I would give!
RAK/RAK0026360
Huh?
MRK/MRK0007130
Truth is, becoming top idol is just a stepping stone.
MRK/MRK0007140
Yes....a very important step towards a[nl]wonderful love affair with my darling Raku!
RAK/RAK0026370
W-What the hell are you saying!?
MRK/MRK0007150
It's a grand plan that might[nl]take a long time to explain, but should I[nl]tell you anyway?
MRK/MRK0007160
It shall be a love story for the ages,[nl]made with sweat and tears, and it shall be[nl]a feature film--
RAK/RAK0026380
Stop, stop! That's enough!
RAK/RAK0026390
If you have the time to talk about[nl]such frivolous things, you should spend it[nl]resting until lesson time!
MRK/MRK0007170
Oh my, you don't need to hesitate like that.
RAK/RAK0026400
Jeez, I can't even tell if you're serious.
MRK/MRK0007180
Hehehe.....women are more mysterious when[nl]they have a lot of mysteries.
RAK/RAK0026410
That's what that means.
MRK/MRK0007190
Anyway, I'm resting in a place you[nl]don't know about, so don't worry about that.
MRK/MRK0007200
Well then, I'm headed off to my lessons.
RAK/RAK0026420
Okay....don't let me stop you.
RAK/RAK0026430
But if you feel out of breath or anything,[nl]stop and give me a call, okay?
MRK/MRK0007210
Okay~!

RAK/RAK0026440
Phew....somehow, I feel like I've been cheated.
RAK/RAK0026450
(....Of course, it wasn't me[nl] who made that wish on Otama.)
RAK/RAK0026460
(And there isn't even any guarantee[nl] that Tachibana will reach the top.[nl] She'll have to rely on herself for that....)
RAK/RAK0026470
I'll have to make sure she doesn't overexert herself.

I just want to be of help to my tired friend!

Well....that's good to hear.
SYU/SYU0001810
Well then, my good man....[nl]Do you have any other idol's email addresses?
RAK/RAK0026510
I didn't ask anyone.[nl]I don't want to be involved[nl]with anyone other than Tachibana.

Sorry about this, Shuu....[nl]She'll confiscate all your photos,[nl]but it's for the best....
MRK/MRK0007270
Thank you again for sending that for me.
RAK/RAK0026560
After all, you're a very popular idol.[nl]If you aren't responsible about your work,[nl]the producer and your dad won't be too happy.
RAK/RAK0026570
But....it has been a long three months.
MRK/MRK0007280
Yeah. The national idol election is tomorrow.
RAK/RAK0026580
Somehow, even with all that work[nl]and all those lessons, you didn't even collapse once.
RAK/RAK0026590
You've got all these fans, and a lot of work....[nl]You're honestly great.
RAK/RAK0026600
I'm starting to see you a bit differently.
MRK/MRK0007290
Come on, I'd like you to just[nl]say you're absolutely smitten.
RAK/RAK0026610
I-I'm not going to say that!
MRK/MRK0007300
Even after all this time we've spent together,[nl]you're still so cold....
MRK/MRK0007310
It feels like, with how busy I am,[nl]I haven't been able to talk with you very much....
RAK/RAK0026620
If you get number one in the election,[nl]won't you be even busier?
RAK/RAK0026630
I think, if that happens, you'll get even further away....[nl]I'll probably miss you, too.
MRK/MRK0007320
You needn't worry about that.
RAK/RAK0026640
Huh...? What do you mean?
MRK/MRK0007330
No matter how far apart we get,[nl]I will always be running towards you at full speed.
MRK/MRK0007340
That was true for the last 10 years,[nl]and it's still true, and will always be true.
RAK/RAK0026650
I-I see....

MRK/MRK0007350
Oh, manager, your face is turning red.
RAK/RAK0026660

Crap....I shouldn't have said anything weird.
MRK/MRK0007390
Awww, please answer honestly.

Shut up! I'm going home,[nl]and you should get some sleep, too!
RAK/RAK0026720
You don't want to collapse at the last minute, right?
MRK/MRK0007400
It's fine. I'll take number one with flying colors[nl]tomorrow, so look forward to it, okay?
RAK/RAK0026730
Okay....well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

Okay. Have a good night, Raku dearest.

Sorry for the delay, Raku dearest!

Are you okay? Are you feeling sick?

Too busy sleeping....you overslept!

More or less.

MRK/MRK0007480
You understand me so well, Raku dearest.

Are you actually already smitten with me?

Hey, Tachibana....[nl]Honda's been pretty quiet for a while now.

Raku dearest, your pacing is bothering everyone else.

Please come sit next to me.
RAK/RAK0026890
Are you sure you're set to go on stage?[nl]Shouldn't you warm up or something and make sure?

Ohh?
MRK/MRK0007610
Well....Raku dearest, this is now[nl]the second time you've held me like this.
MRK/MRK0007620
I was able to hide it better than[nl]at the tennis match, but to be found out[nl]at the last minute like this....
MRK/MRK0007630
I guess I've got a ways to go....
RAK/RAK0026930
How long have you been hiding it?
MRK/MRK0007640
....That's a secret.
RAK/RAK0026940
(Crap....I'm such an idiot![nl] How could I have missed something so obvious!?)
RAK/RAK0026950
(After all, I knew all along that Tachibana's[nl] the sort of person who will push herself[nl] until she collapses!)
RAK/RAK0026960
How are you feeling now?[nl]A bit better, since you're lying down?
MRK/MRK0007650
Yes. Thank you very much.
MRK/MRK0007660
If I rest like this for a while,[nl]I should be able to sing one song on stage.
RAK/RAK0026970
You're really going to pull that in your condition....

....Mistress, please don't be selfish.
RAK/RAK0026980
!![nl]Honda....
HND/HND0000350
I have been observing your behavior until now,[nl]but this time you have been far too reckless.
MRK/MRK0007670
....Yes. I understand.
HND/HND0000360
Do you understand the effects this will have on your body?
MRK/MRK0007680
Well....
HND/HND0000370
Since you don't seem to know, let me tell you.
HND/HND0000380
If your condition gets much worse,[nl]you may be put in a sanatorium,[nl]like you were when you were a child.
HND/HND0000390
You will also have to part ways with Mr. Ichijo.
HND/HND0000400
Is it worth the risk?
RAK/RAK0026990
Did you really push that far without telling me?
MRK/MRK0007690
Honda, that's just awful....
MRK/MRK0007700
To expose me like that in front of Raku dearest....[nl]That's just unfair.
HND/HND0000410
I will not make excuses.[nl]I am not here to give you what you want.
HND/HND0000420
This is your final warning.[nl]....Withdraw from the competition.

RAK/RAK0027010
H-Hey....don't tell me you're actually going to perform?
MRK/MRK0007740
As expected of Raku dearest.[nl]You understand me better than Honda.
MRK/MRK0007750
I am a woman who follows through with her word.
MRK/MRK0007760
And I will not cave to such cheap threats!

You should be more concerned about why[nl]the mistress....why that girl is going this far.
RAK/RAK0027050
HND/HND0000460
It's all because she wants you to see it.
HND/HND0000470
It's a foolish thing to do[nl]for something so trivial.
HND/HND0000480
This is nothing new. For 10 years now, she's....

She's....she's been running at a[nl]breakneck pace, just to reach you.
RAK/RAK0027060
Just to reach me....

I-I......
HND/HND0000520
I'll leave it up to you whether[nl]to stop her or give her a push.

After all, what she needs is your voice.

Look, Raku dearest. The ocean is so beautiful.
RAK/RAK0027330
...Yep.
MRK/MRK0008050
Hey, look, do you see those dolphins?[nl]Haha....they're so cute.
RAK/RAK0027340
MRK/MRK0008060
Why are you still so distant, Raku dearest?[nl]It's already been a month.
MRK/MRK0008070
Come on, lighten up and have some fun with me~.
RAK/RAK0027350
Well....do you remember whose fault it is[nl]that we can't go back to Japan?
RAK/RAK0027360
After the election, you---
MAS/MAS0000030
Marika![nl]Congratulations on placing first in the election!
MAS/MAS0000040
Is there anyone you wish to dedicate this victory to?
MRK/MRK0008080
Well, of course....
MRK/MRK0008090
My much-beloved darling Raku!
MAS/MAS0000050
Uh...? Darling Raku Ichijo?[nl]What kind of relationship do the two of you have?
MRK/MRK0008100
He is my fiancee!
MAS/MAS0000060
F-Fianceeeeee!?
MRK/MRK0008110
And today, Raku dearest has confessed his love to me!
MRK/MRK0008120
So, I will go back to being an ordinary girl,[nl]shining for one man alone.
FNA/FNA0000030G
What the hellll!?
FNA/FNA0000040
Hey! Where the hell is[nl]that bastard Raku Ichijo!?
FNB/FNB0000040
Come out this instant and explain![nl]No, let me hit you!
MRK/MRK0008130
Everyone! You're perfectly welcome to hate me,[nl]but please do not hate Raku dearest!
RAK/RAK0027370
...You said something like that,[nl]and now the whole country is mad at me.
MRK/MRK0008140
Ehehe.....It's difficult being popular, isn't it...
RAK/RAK0027380
That was your fault!
RAK/RAK0027390
Thankfully, Honda arranged for me to hide out here....[nl]But I can't go back to Japan until this blows over....
MRK/MRK0008150
It's like we're eloping. It's so romantic.
RAK/RAK0027400
Those Beehive guys, Chitoge, Onodera....aagh![nl]How am I going to explain myself?
RAK/RAK0027410
We've got a lot of trouble[nl]waiting for us back in Japan, I guess....
MRK/MRK0008160
That's fine with me.[nl]We can solve them together.
MRK/MRK0008170
As long as you choose me, Raku dearest,[nl]I'll be happy no matter what.
RAK/RAK0027420
Jeez....I guess I lost to your pushiness.
MRK/MRK0008180
Ehehe. If you keep yelling, you'll embarrass me.
MRK/MRK0008190
I will continue to improve myself and[nl]make myself an even more wonderful girl for you.
MRK/MRK0008200
So please make sure you watch me.
MRK/MRK0008210
Watch me the whole way through. Okay?

RAK/RAK0027430
If you really want to compete,[nl]then I'll support you all the way.
RAK/RAK0027440
Work until you drop.[nl]I'll follow you.
MRK/MRK0008220
RAK/RAK0027450
(This is probably all I can do[nl] towards reciprocating her feelings right now.)
RAK/RAK0027460
(I don't have what it takes to[nl] properly respond to her feelings.)
RAK/RAK0027470
(That would be disrespectful to Chitoge, to Onodera....[nl]and even to Tachibana.)
RAK/RAK0027480
....As your manager, Marika Tachibana,[nl]I believe in you.
MRK/MRK0008230
As my manager, huh.
MRK/MRK0008240
Actually, I was hoping for[nl]something a little more intimate....
RAK/RAK0027490
Huh?
MRK/MRK0008250
But, this will do for now.
MRK/MRK0008260
As long as Raku dearest believes in me,[nl]I will go through hell an back.
RAK/RAK0027500
O-Okay. Got it....
MRK/MRK0008270
Well, I'm on.
MRK/MRK0008280
Everyone....thank you for waiting!
RAK/RAK0027510
Tachibana....good luck.
RAK/RAK0027520
Hello!? Yes....you want to[nl]perform with Marika Tachibana?
RAK/RAK0027530
I'm sorry.[nl]Her schedule is booked solid for the next 6 months.
RAK/RAK0027540
Yes....yes....thank you.[nl]Thank you again.
MRK/MRK0008290
Fwah.....I'm back.
RAK/RAK0027550
Oh, welcome back. I'm answering the[nl]phone right now, so sit down and have a rest.
MRK/MRK0008300
Hahh....I can't remember the last time[nl]we had a proper conversation, Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0008310
I've cancelled the rest of today's work already....
HND/HND0000550
Unfortunately, you must leave[nl]immediately for the next venue.
MRK/MRK0008320
Uuugh.....already?[nl]I haven't even been back for one minute.
MRK/MRK0008330
If I keep working this hard,[nl]I may just collapse again....
RAK/RAK0027560
Yes, okay![nl]Excuse me, yes!
HND/HND0000560
Rest assured, mistress, that we are[nl]monitoring your health even more closely now.
HND/HND0000570
I don't want another scare like we had at the election.
MRK/MRK0008340
Honda....is it possible you are still angry with me?
RAK/RAK0027570
It's only natural.
RAK/RAK0027580
You ignored her warnings,[nl]went on stage, and collapsed....
HND/HND0000580
Yes. You got what you deserved.
MRK/MRK0008350
Hahh....[nl]I didn't end up winning top idol,[nl]and now Honda is angry with me.
RAK/RAK0027590
On top of that, your collapse went viral,[nl]and now you're working three times as hard as before.
MRK/MRK0008360
I only ever have a chance to talk to my darling Raku[nl]at work, and I feel further away from him than ever....
MRK/MRK0008370
Raku dearest![nl]Even though we don't have time to talk,[nl]at least let me give you a hug~!
RAK/RAK0027600
Wha!? Hey, don't hug me! Get off me!
MRK/MRK0008380
Hahh~....[nl]Raku dearest, you're so warm. I'm so happy....
MRK/MRK0008390
Please watch me, Raku dearest.[nl]I'm sure I will become top idol in the next election!
RAK/RAK0027610
Okay. That's why I'm supporting you.[nl]Let's do our best together, then.
MRK/MRK0008400
Okay!
RAK/RAK0027620
....Hey, by the way,[nl]why do you want to become top idol so badly?
MRK/MRK0008410
Uhh....well....
MRK/MRK0008420
W-Why was it?
RAK/RAK0027630
I feel like I missed something important....
HND/HND0000590
With all due respect, Mr. Ichijo,[nl]you should be trying to remember what's next on the docket.
RAK/RAK0027640
Oh, oh no! We're going to be late!
RAK/RAK0027650
Let's go to the next venue, Tachibana!
MRK/MRK0008430
I'll follow you anywhere, Raku dearest. ★
RAK/RAK0027660
Ahh, well, maybe you could stand[nl]a little further away from me for now.
MRK/MRK0008440
Aaah, Raku dearest,[nl]you just don't have any energy anymore~!
RAK/RAK0027670
Aghhh, we're too busy right now....!
RAK/RAK0027680
I'm so busy, I can barely think.[nl]Today's just work, work, work!
MRK/MRK0008450
Fwahh....Raku dearest,[nl]you've really gotten into the role of manager.
MRK/MRK0008460
I didn't exactly mean for this to happen....[nl]but I guess it's okay.
MRK/MRK0008470
To have my darling Raku all to myself in any way,[nl]it makes me very happy.
MRK/MRK0008480
Raku dearest, I hope you stay with me for a long time.
