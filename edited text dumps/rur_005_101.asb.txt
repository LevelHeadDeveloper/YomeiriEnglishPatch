You can't fool me anymore, Ichijo.[nl]Aren't you and Maiko on speaking terms anyway?
RUR/RUR0004480
Why are the pictures from the cafe here[nl]if I supposedly smashed the camera?
RUR/RUR0004490
If you're innocent, then you[nl]can tell me how that's possible.
Explain this....
Shuu fixed the camera
There were actually two cameras
The data was backed up
RUR/RUR0004500
I smashed it to smithereens,[nl]including the memory card, remember?
RUR/RUR0004510
I find it very hard to believe he[nl]could have repaired it.

You're saying the camera I broke was a decoy[nl]and he secretly had another one?
RUR/RUR0004530
Really, that's as shrewd as Maiko is.
@rur_005_102
RUR/RUR0004540
That would explain the other photos.
RUR/RUR0004550
But he couldn't possibly have backed up the photos[nl]taken the day I smashed the memory card.
RUR/RUR0004560
How do you explain this picture of me[nl]with my mouth full of cake!?
RUR/RUR0004570
Your silence....[nl]means you're complicit after all!?
