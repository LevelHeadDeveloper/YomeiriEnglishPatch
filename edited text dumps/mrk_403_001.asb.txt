Dar・ling! ★[nl]Dinner's ready.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023310
On tonight's menu,[nl]we have plain miso soup with salt.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023320
My apologies. I couldn't manage[nl]anything special. This month, I've completely[nl]run out of living expenses.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023330
There's no rice either,[nl]so we'll have to survive the month on[nl]just miso and salt.
@expose
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023340
Oh, what's the matter?[nl]You look a bit dazed.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023350
You have an expression that seems to say[nl]you don't have a grasp on the current situation.
We eloped?
Hallucinating?
April fools?
@mrk_403_149
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023380
Yes, that is correct.[nl]And this is our modest new home. ♪
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023390
After high school, some stuff happened,[nl]and we chose to elope.
@mrk_403_150
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023400
Surely you're joking. ♪
@mrk_403_151
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023410
No, that is incorrect.
@mrk_403_152
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023420
Come on, what's the matter?[nl]This is the real deal,[nl]the genuine reality....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023430
After high school, some stuff happened,[nl]and we decided to elope, right?
@mrk_403_153
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023440
Really, so much has happened[nl]since high school....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023450
After graduation, [nl]Onodera went on that journey of self-discovery[nl]to Africa, as I recall....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023460
I heard Tsugumi joined the Buddhist order[nl]and now spends her days carving Buddha[nl]statues deep in the mountains at a temple.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023470
And then Miyamoto became a comedian....[nl]Who would have guessed that?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023480
And then....[nl]I feel like I'm forgetting someone,[nl]but moving right along.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023490
In any case, even though both our[nl]families approved of our marriage,[nl]after overcoming various obstacles....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023500
....we ultimately decided to leave home[nl]and make our own path through life.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023510
Do you remember[nl]what our current situation is like?
#fs{12}Don't put us through[nl]hardship#fs{}
#fs{12}If only we[nl]hadn't eloped....#fs{}
How's your health?
@mrk_403_154
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023520
Please stop, dear.[nl]I've never considered any[nl]of this hardship.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023530
Borrowing soy sauce from next door,[nl]or rice from the neighbors across the street....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023540
Holding my breath so the debt collectors[nl]don't know we're home, walking three stations[nl]to save on train fare....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023550
None of it troubles me.[nl]If I can be with you, that is[nl]happiness enough for me.
@mrk_403_155
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023560
No! Please don't talk like that.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023570
This was the only way[nl]we could be together.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023580
So there are no regrets.[nl]At least, not for me.
@mrk_403_156
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023590
Wow! ★[nl]You really are so kind.[nl]....I'm falling for you all over again! ★
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023600
I'm in tip-top shape![nl]Well, not quite tip-top,[nl]but I'm holding together okay.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023610
Being here by your side[nl]is the best medicine for me.
@mrk_403_157
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023620
It's alright, we can manage[nl]without money if we're resourceful.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023630
As long as we know in what order[nl]the utilities will get cut,[nl]we can survive.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023640
If we get friendly with the local baker[nl]and they give us some scraps,[nl]that will be our meal for the day.
You've grown strong.
Money is still good
@mrk_403_158
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023650
Hehehe, thank you.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023660
Indeed, I may be a little bit[nl]stronger compared to where I was.
@mrk_403_159
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023670
A baseline amount of money[nl]is absolutely necessary.[nl]But that's quite enough.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023680
After all, your presence is[nl]something that money absolutely[nl]cannot replace.
@mrk_403_160
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023690
....Achoo!
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023700
Still, it's a bitter cold night.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023710
Hey, darling.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023720
Can I come in[nl]a little closer?
@背景変更
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023730
Hehe, you're so warm....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023740
I just adore the moments we spend[nl]together, snuggled up like this.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023750
Those with home heating will[nl]probably never understand such joys.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023760
To know the pleasure of sharing warmth[nl]with someone so dear....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023770
I am really a fortunate soul....

Oh....have you woken up?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023790
You were sleeping quite soundly.[nl]I trust my lap was a comfortable pillow?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023800
We're in school, you know.[nl]We were having lunch together during the break.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023810
And then you fell asleep[nl]in my lap....
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023820
It seems you were having a dream[nl]of some kind. What was it about?
We eloped together
We were very poor
@mrk_403_161
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023830
Huh!? You ran away with me[nl]to pursue our love!?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023840
Well now! I'm absolutely delighted[nl]that you had a dream like that!
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023850
Overcoming shared troubles through[nl]the power of love. What a nice dream!
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023860
But surely it's not *just* a dream.[nl]It's a prophetic dream, and it's[nl]predicting our future!
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023870
In fact, why don't we *make* it[nl]a prophetic dream? We can get[nl]started right now!
@expose2
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023880
Well then, how about we skip our[nl]afternoon classes and run away together?[nl]Huh?
@マジコイ終了処理
@mrk_403_162
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023890
Huh!? A dream where we were[nl]living a simple and modest life together,[nl]just the two of us!?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023900
Overcoming shared troubles through[nl]the power of love. What a nice dream.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023910
Huh? You still didn't[nl]like being poor?
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023920
Hehehe. Don't worry.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023930
I'll save not just for our wedding,[nl]but also for our future[nl]living expenses.
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023940
I just couldn't bear to let[nl]my beloved suffer any hardship.
@expose
MJK1_MRK/MRK0023950
*That* part of your dream[nl]shall not come true.
