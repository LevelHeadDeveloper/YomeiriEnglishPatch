....No good![nl]Those guys are guarding too well,[nl]we can't get to Shuu!
RUR/RUR0015980
What are you whining about?[nl]If you're Maiko's friend, you should take responsibility[nl]to the very end.
RUR/RUR0015990
Otherwise, everything you've done so far....[nl]will be announced in a school-wide broadcast,[nl]including the fact that you were complicit.
RAK/RAK0083170
u-U-Understood!
RAK/RAK0083180
(Sorry, Shuu. I can't protect you any longer.[nl] For the sake of my future life,[nl] I have to help Ruri punish you once and for all!)
RUR/RUR0016000
We'll keep looking until we find him!

RAK/RAK0031570
Found you, Shuu!
SYU/SYU0004280
Oh, Raku----
SYU/SYU0004290
GAAH, RURI!?
SYU/SYU0004300
I see, so everything's been discovered....
RUR/RUR0005300
I've finally cornered you, Maiko.[nl]Give up and hand over the photo album.
SYU/SYU0004310
I can't do that, Ruri.
SYU/SYU0004320
This photo book is the culmination of my passion.[nl]I can't give up on it....
@expose
SYU/SYU0004330
Isn't that right, guys?
MSA/MSA0000090
T-That's right!
MSC/MSC0000040
No matter how much Miyamoto asks us,[nl]we aren't giving up our soul's--
RUR/RUR0005310
Huh....?[nl]Did I say you could talk, small fry!?
@expose2
MSA/MSA0000100G
E-Eeeeek!!
RAK/RAK0031580
(Amazing....[nl] All she had to do was glare at them[nl] and they left....!)
@背景変更
RUR/RUR0005320
Well, Maiko, this is checkmate.[nl]Hand over those booklets and turn yourself in.
RAK/RAK0031590
That's right, Shuu. All your customers ran away[nl]because they're scared of Ruri. For your own safety,[nl]you'd better turn yourself in.

SYU/SYU0004340
Heh....Heheh......
SYU/SYU0004350
Hehahahaha.....
@ＢＧＭ再生
SYU/SYU0004360
Gyahahahaha!
RUR/RUR0005330
What's so funny?[nl]I don't think you understand the gravity[nl]of your situation right now.
SYU/SYU0004370
No, I just realized how blind I've been.
RAK/RAK0031600
Blind? What do you mean?
SYU/SYU0004380
I mean that the ultimate moe I was looking for[nl]was right under my nose the whole time!
SYU/SYU0004390
The power to find and enter the black market,[nl]evading the pursuit of numerous men....[nl]And the boldness to intimidate anyone with a single glare....!
SYU/SYU0004400
Even I shuddered at the sight....![nl]Maaan, girls with glasses are so cool!
SYU/SYU0004410
Thank you, Ruri, for reminding me.[nl]Sure enough, girls with glasses are great!
SYU/SYU0004420
Yes! Through Ruri's efforts,[nl]I have been awakened to the fact[nl]that I like girls with glasses!
SYU/SYU0004430
I may have lost this time, but one day,[nl]Shuu Maiko and his black market will return!
SYU/SYU0004440
And when I return, I will sell a photo book[nl]of only girls with glasses! Of course,[nl]Ruri will have to be on the cover!
RAK/RAK0031610
What a terribly positive outcome you've dreamed up....
RUR/RUR0005340
Well, in a word, it's stupid.
SYU/SYU0004450
Banzai for girls with glasses![nl]Viva la glasses girls!
RUR/RUR0005350
Let's get this over with.
@フェードアウト
RAK/RAK0031620
You threw not just the photo books, but the camera[nl]and memory cards into the incinerator....[nl]You're relentless.
RUR/RUR0005360
No point being lenient if you're not good at it.[nl]Besides, Maiko could stand to reflect on his actions.
RAK/RAK0031630
Yeah, I dunno. He isn't exactly the kind of person[nl]who reflects on his actions....
RUR/RUR0005370
What he was saying about girls with glasses[nl]kinda bothers me....
RUR/RUR0005380
I have a weird, bad feeling about this.
