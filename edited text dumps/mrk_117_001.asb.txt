Hahh....[nl]Where on Earth did I drop it....?
MRK/MRK0014390
I can't believe I had to do *that* and drop it!
RAK/RAK0077520
(Looks like Tachibana's looking for something.)
RAK/RAK0077570
(Ah, that reminds me....)
RAK/RAK0077580
Hey, Tachibana.[nl]Is this what you're looking for?

MRK/MRK0014430
Oh! How did you get that picture, Raku dearest!?
RAK/RAK0077590
I picked it up when you bumped into me that one time,[nl]but I completely forgot to give it back.
MRK/MRK0014440
Thank you very much![nl]I've been looking for it for so long!
MRK/MRK0014450
Ahhh.[nl]I'm so glad you found it!

RAK/RAK0077600
That's a picture we took together way back when.[nl]I found one at my place too.
MRK/MRK0014460
Is that so?[nl]I thought I was the only one who had this photo....
RAK/RAK0077610
I found it just before you transferred here, too.[nl]I had no idea I'd meet the girl in that photo so soon.
MRK/MRK0014470
I didn't realize that.[nl]As for me, I looked at this picture every day, waiting for[nl]the day when I'd see you again, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0077620
Oogh.... Hurts to hear that.[nl]I'm so sorry I forgot about all that, Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0014480
It's fine, I'm already over it.
MRK/MRK0014490
More importantly, I'm surprised to hear you had the same photo.[nl]Now that it feels like we share some memories, I'm glad.
RAK/RAK0077630
But things have changed a lot over the last 10 years,[nl]like you'd expect. I was such a small child back then.
MRK/MRK0014500
Hehe.... You were cute when you were small, too, Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0014510
But, even this cute little darling Raku[nl]was such a cool and dependable boy to me at the time.
RAK/RAK0077640
Huh, really?
MRK/MRK0014520
Yes. I spent my days bored in bed, and he told me all kinds[nl]of stories about his adventures, and all about the outside world, too.
MRK/MRK0014530
For me, it was more exciting, more thrilling,[nl]and much more fun than any adventure story I've ever heard.
RAK/RAK0077650
I'm glad to hear it. But....[nl]When you heap on the praise like that, I get embarrassed.
MRK/MRK0014540
That's just how much I looked up to you, Raku dearest.[nl]To me, you are like a knight in shining armor, so to speak.
RAK/RAK0077660
K-Knight in shining armor!?
RAK/RAK0077670
....Jeez, you're exaggerating.[nl]I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing special about me.
MRK/MRK0014550
That's not true at all.[nl]Raku dearest, you're kind, and you're manly....
MRK/MRK0014560
Besides, if you marry me, you can even take over[nl]as the chief of police one day. Following in my father's footsteps!
RAK/RAK0077680
No, I don't really intend to do that....[nl]I mean, that position isn't even hereditary.
MRK/MRK0014570
Don't worry. I'll make sure to help you become[nl]the most beloved hero in all Japan....no, the world!
RAK/RAK0077690
I told you, I don't want that!
RAK/RAK0077530
Looking for something, Tachibana?
MRK/MRK0014400
Oh, Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0077540
You want me to help you look for it?
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0014410
No, thanks....[nl]It's not big enough for you to bother with, Raku dearest....[nl]Please don't worry about it....
MRK/MRK0014420
See you later....
RAK/RAK0077550
(If it's not big enough to bother with,[nl] why the hell does she look so sad?)
RAK/RAK0077560
(What the hell is she looking for?)
