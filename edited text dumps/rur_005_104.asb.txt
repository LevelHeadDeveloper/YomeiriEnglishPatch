I'm starting to get a sense of your innocence,[nl]but it's too bad there's no conclusive evidence....
RUR/RUR0004820
Now it's a matter of whether or not I trust you....
RUR/RUR0004830
Hey, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0004840
Can you look me in the eye[nl]and tell me you weren't involved?

....You don't sound like you're lying.

RUR/RUR0004860
I understand.[nl]I believe you, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0004870
Did you just stutter?
RUR/RUR0004880
That's a telltale sign of your guilty conscience.
RUR/RUR0004890
The fact that you faltered there[nl]is a telltale sign of your guilty conscience.
RUR/RUR0004900
....Where were you just looking?
RUR/RUR0004910
That's very telling of your desires....[nl]I knew it, you're guilty.
RUR/RUR0004920
....Oh. You averted your eyes.[nl]That's a telltale sign of your guilty conscience.
