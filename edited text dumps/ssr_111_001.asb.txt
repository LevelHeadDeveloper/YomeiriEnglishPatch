Hey, hey, daaarling! ★[nl]Where should we go for our date after school today?
RAK/RAK0054410
As long as I have you, honey, I'd be happy with anything,[nl]be it a burnt field or a manure heap!
CTG/CTG0014070
What a coincidence! I was thinking the same thing!
CTG/CTG0014080
But I wish you'd pick a more decent spot anyway,[nl]my idiot darling! ★[nl]You're as stupid and cute as always! ♪
RAK/RAK0054420
Hahahaha, just kidding, honeyyy![nl]I just wanted to see your angry gorilla face!
@expose
CTG/CTG0014090
Come on, daaarling![nl]One more word and I'll make you cryyyy!
RAK/RAK0054430
Haha, haha....[nl]I was joking again!
CTG/CTG0014100
Well, how can you be so good at making unfunny jokes!?[nl]You're just too good at that, darling!
@expose2
RAK/RAK0054440G
Hahahahahahaha!

You two are really acting extra lovey-dovey today,[nl]aren't you? It's so unnatural!
RAK/RAK0054460
Y-You idiot! We're *always* this lovey-dovey![nl]I'm just crazy about honey here.
CTG/CTG0014130
Yeah! And no one loves my darling as much as I do. ★
MRK/MRK0010740
Here! There's someone right here![nl]My love for him is way stronger!
RAK/RAK0054470
(For god's sake, just shut up, Tachibana!)
RUR/RUR0011720
....It's honestly *too* unnatural.[nl]Kosaki, do you know what's up?
KSK/KSK0016740
No.... But given them,[nl]they probably have a great reason.

CLD/CLD0001930
....Nothing out of the ordinary.
RAK/RAK0054480
Hey, Chitoge. Just how long is the[nl]"Raku Ichijo Surveillance Week" gonna last?
RAK/RAK0054490
Having Claude watching me morning, noon, and night[nl]honestly has me at my limit....
CTG/CTG0014140
Sorry....I don't know either.
CTG/CTG0014150
But Claude is absolutely determined to[nl]uncover our fake relationship this time.
CTG/CTG0014160
Of course, Tsugumi's part of it....
.........
SSR/SSR0013990
....Hey, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0054500
W-What is it?
SSR/SSR0014000
I've been watching you up until today,[nl]and there's one thing that's been bugging me.
SSR/SSR0014010
But now I'm sure of it.[nl]I've realized something.
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0054510
R-Realized....what, exactly?
SSR/SSR0014020
You're trying to play dumb, huh.[nl]Heh. Fine, then I'll tell you. It's--
RAK/RAK0054520G
I-It's...!?
SSR/SSR0014030
It's that I love the Mistress more than you after alllll!
CTG/CTG0014180
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0054530
Huh!?
SSR/SSR0014040
Everything you've said about her is superficial and vague![nl]Tell me, specifically, what you like about the Mistress!
RAK/RAK0054540
.....Not this again.
SSR/SSR0014050
You can't answer me straight away?[nl]How can you call yourself her lover, then!?
SSR/SSR0014060
I can tell you what *I* like about her![nl]Ten things, or a hundred, right off the top of my head!
RAK/RAK0054550
SSR/SSR0014070
Even if she's sad, the Mistress can put a smile[nl]right back on her face by eating a lot of food![nl]That kind of positivity is wonderful!
SSR/SSR0014080
When she's sleeping happily with drool on her face,[nl]she looks like an angel! And the fact that she talks[nl]about food in her sleep is adorable, too!
CTG/CTG0014190
Hey, hang on...![nl]None of these feel like compliments at all!
SSR/SSR0014090
And there's so many more things!
SSR/SSR0014100
When we're bathing together, she always hugs me from[nl]behind, and the way she wanders around her room,[nl]searching for her underwear, warms my heart....
CTG/CTG0014200
Kyaaaaaaahh! How dare you say that in public!!
SSR/SSR0014110
Huh? Was that bad?
CTG/CTG0014210
Of course it was!
SYU/SYU0009170
Ohhh.....so you're doing *those* things together!?[nl]I knew you were great friends!
SYU/SYU0009180
It makes me so happy to hear all that![nl]Nice, Seishiro!
RAK/RAK0054560
By the way, why would you be searching[nl]for underwear? It doesn't seem like the[nl]sort of thing you'd need to look for....
CTG/CTG0014220
Shut up!
@ＨＰ－３０
RAK/RAK0054570
Glptchk!
CTG/CTG0014230
Not another word about any of this![nl]Or I'll pummel you both!
RAK/RAK0054580
....You've already pummeled me.
CTG/CTG0014240
Tsugumi, stop saying such weird things at school. Idiot!
SSR/SSR0014120
Aaaah! The Mistress called me an idiot!?
SSR/SSR0014130
No, please wait uuuuuup![nl]Missssstressss!
MRK/MRK0010750
Tsugumi loses all awareness of everything else[nl]when it comes to Chitoge. Poor young lady.
RAK/RAK0054590
You're one to talk....
