Ya know how sometimes you see food that has[nl]the word "delicious" built right into the name?[nl]I think that's cheating!
RAK/RAK0043130
Yeah, 'cause you just have to buy it when[nl]it's got a name like that, right? I see what you're saying.
KSK/KSK0010650
It's the same at sweet shops. Sometimes a menu item[nl]will be labeled "patissier's choice" to make it sound tastier.

KSK/KSK0010660
Right, Ruri?
…………。
KSK/KSK0010670
....Ruri?
RUR/RUR0009450
....Don't worry about it.[nl]Go ahead and keep talking.
RUR/RUR0009460
I'm just gonna step out for a bit.
KSK/KSK0010680
....O-Okay.
KSK/KSK0010690
What's the matter with Ruri?
RAK/RAK0043140
Maybe she's not feeling well.[nl]I'm gonna run to the bathroom, and check on her while I'm up.
KSK/KSK0010700
Oh, sure.

RAK/RAK0043150
(Okayyyy, Miyamoto....[nl] Oh, there she is.)
RAK/RAK0043160
....Huh!?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0043170
(M-Miyamoto's crying!?!?)
RAK/RAK0043180
(W-W-What should I do!?)
Try talking to her anyway
Watch quietly
RAK/RAK0043190
M-Miyamoto! What's wrong!?[nl]Are you hurt!? Are you sick!?
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0009470
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0043200
Huh? Wait.[nl]Just now, you were crying!
RUR/RUR0009480
Oh, that?
RUR/RUR0009490
No, I was just using some eyedrops.[nl]I'd gotten an eyelash stuck in my eye, and it hurt.
RAK/RAK0043210
Oh, was that it?
RAK/RAK0043220
I see. That's why you were[nl]acting strange earlier.
RUR/RUR0009500
....Sheesh.[nl]You're always sticking your nose in and[nl]misunderstanding things.
RAK/RAK0043230
(I guess even Miyamoto gets depressed sometimes....)
RAK/RAK0043240
I'd better not tell this to anyone....
RUR/RUR0009510
Better not tell what to anyone?
RAK/RAK0043250
Waaaagh!? M-Miyamoto!?
RUR/RUR0009520
Let me tell you, I wasn't crying just now.[nl]I was just using some eyedrops because I'd gotten[nl]a last stuck in my eye and it hurt.
RAK/RAK0043260
But Onodera was worried about you too, you know.
RUR/RUR0009530
Ohh, I see. Alright, I'll clear that up for her later.[nl]Thanks for taking the trouble.
RAK/RAK0043270
Sure.
