Ghhh....[nl]Can't believe I'd lose to Raku, of all people.

MRK/MRK0010970
That's just like you, Raku dearest.[nl]You're so strong!
RAK/RAK0062860
So will you all stop fighting now?
CTG/CTG0014770
Well....it was probably a terrible idea to[nl]decide who your girlfriend would be based on a game of cards.

MRK/MRK0010980
Kyaah! ★[nl]Raku dearest, you're wonderful for resolving our disputes!

Alright! I won!
MRK/MRK0011000
From this day forward, I....[nl]I, Marika Tachibana, will henceforth be your girlfriend!
CTG/CTG0014780
Ghh.... T-This shouldn't count, not one bit![nl]This isn't something we should be deciding based on a game[nl]of Old Maid!
SSR/SSR0019880
That's right! I will never accept you[nl]as Raku Ichijo's lover!
RAK/RAK0062870
(Aaargh, jeez![nl] I just knew they'd do this!)

Hahaaa! Whaddya say to that, Marika!?[nl]You'd better apologize to me right away! ♪
SSR/SSR0019890
That's right. And promise us that from now on,[nl]you'll never meddle with the Mistress or Raku Ichijo ever again!
MRK/MRK0011010
Mgghh.... This shouldn't count![nl]This isn't the sort of thing we should be settling[nl]with a game of Old Maid!
CTG/CTG0014800
Whaaaat!? That's not fair!
@ano_603_ssr
SSR/SSR0019900
Hehe, I win. Now, Marika Tachibana, promise us that[nl]you'll never meddle with the Mistress or Raku Ichijo[nl]ever again!
@ano_603_end
RAK/RAK0062880
Hey, that's enough, alright?[nl]We shouldn't be deciding who I date by playing Old Maid.
CTG/CTG0014810
What are you talking about!? It's your own fault[nl]for being so indecisive! Stupid bean sprout!
RAK/RAK0062890
What!? It's my fault!?
@expose
SSR/SSR0019910
That's right! You're always fawning over someone or other!
MRK/MRK0011020
Raku dearest, please keep your promise!
RAK/RAK0062900
Eeeek! R-Run awaaaay!
