SYU/SYU0004460
Well, Raku. Lemme tell you about that[nl]"Girls-with-glasses Photo Collection" I was telling[nl]you about the other day.
RAK/RAK0031640
Still talking about that....[nl]You never learn, huh.
@expose
SYU/SYU0004470
Obviously. The incident the other day convinced me.[nl]The "glasses girl" wave is coming, for sure!
RAK/RAK0031650
Really? I had no idea.
SYU/SYU0004480
Jeez louise, you don't have the slightest inkling of[nl]the merits of girls with glasses.... And as the editor-in-chief[nl]of the "Girls-with-glasses Photo Collection", I am appalled.
RAK/RAK0031660
Stop trying to pull rank on me.
SYU/SYU0004490
Alright! For you, O he of low aspirations,[nl]allow me to tell you how great girls with glasses are!
RAK/RAK0031670
No, I'm fine....
SYU/SYU0004500
Ummm....somewhere we can talk peacefully....
SYU/SYU0004510
Of course. Let's go to the nearby shrine.[nl]We can talk there without worrying about anyone else.
RAK/RAK0031680
You don't need to take the time to talk about this.[nl]Actually, I'd rather mind my own business.
SYU/SYU0004520
Hey, hey, don't be shy. I'm doing this so that[nl]I can make a great photo book and get back at Ruri.
SYU/SYU0004530
Well, let's go.
RAK/RAK0031690
....Seriously, he's appallingly pushy sometimes.
@時間経過演出
SYU/SYU0004540
---Ahem.
SYU/SYU0004550
Well, I haven't quite mastered the art of[nl]admiring girls with glasses to the point that I can[nl]talk about it in depth.
SYU/SYU0004560
Until recently, I found them to be plain.[nl]They tended to be overshadowed by[nl]the more glamorous girls.
SYU/SYU0004570
There are some people who like girls with glasses,[nl]but I didn't really understand them.
SYU/SYU0004580
I was reluctant to make a photo book in that genre[nl]because I thought it would be too risky.
RAK/RAK0031700
First of all, when you're making a photo book[nl]of all the beautiful girls at school,[nl]that would usually be the second step....
SYU/SYU0004590
But, when Ruri was beating me up for trying[nl]to take photos of beautiful girls on campus, I thought....
SYU/SYU0004600
"Hey, girls with glasses are actually good, aren't they?"
SYU/SYU0004610
Isn't it awesome when a girl with glasses usually [nl]looks cool, but has a hot side hidden inside!?[nl]There's not a guy on earth who wouldn't like that contrast.
RAK/RAK0031710
Ummm....I can't say I can relate to that.
SYU/SYU0004620
Is that so? If Onodera wore glasses,[nl]I'm sure you'd notice.
SYU/SYU0004630
Onodera, who's usually quiet, takes off her glasses and says:[nl]"You're the only one who knows my true face, Ichijo-kun".
........
SYU/SYU0004640
See? You liked that, didn't you?
RAK/RAK0031720
No, I mean, while it's a fascinating scene....
RAK/RAK0031730
I think it's more because Onodera's cute by herself,[nl]not because I like glasses....
RUR/RUR0005390
....What's this about Kosaki?
RAK/RAK0031740
Waaagh! Miyamoto![nl]You surprised me!
SYU/SYU0004650
Hiya, Ruri! What are you doing here,[nl]all by yourself in such an unpopular place?
RUR/RUR0005400
I was just curious about the rumors surrounding this shrine.[nl]I stopped by to check it out and heard you guys[nl]talking nonsense.
SYU/SYU0004660
Ah. The rumor that[nl]"any wish you make at this shrine will come true"[nl]or something like that?
RUR/RUR0005410
Right. This shrine's gotten famous[nl]as a power spot these days.
RAK/RAK0031750
(Huh, I didn't know that....)
SYU/SYU0004670
You must be a lonely young lady, Ruri,[nl]to come by yourself to make a wish.
RUR/RUR0005420
I am not.[nl]Kosaki's the one who's wondering about the rumors.[nl]I just came to scope this place out.
RAK/RAK0031760
(Scoping it out so Kosaki can make a wish?[nl] What is it, I wonder....)
SYU/SYU0004680
Hmmm.....a wish, huh.
SYU/SYU0004690
If it were to come true,[nl]I think I'd wish to see everyone[nl]wearing glasses at least once.
SYU/SYU0004700
Obviously Onodera, but imagine Kirisaki and[nl]Marika in glasses.....pretty cool, huh?
RAK/RAK0031770
So, you'd be taking pictures of them[nl]for your girls-with-glasses-photo-book?
SYU/SYU0004710
Yes, yes, you get it.
RUR/RUR0005430
Hahh.....[nl]I didn't know you were still talking about that, Maiko.
RUR/RUR0005440
Just so you know, you won't be making another[nl]indecent booklet like the last one on my watch.
RUR/RUR0005450
While I'm at it, I'll tell Chitoge and the others[nl]to refuse a photo shoot if you ask them.
SYU/SYU0004720
Gehh.....you're trying to stop me from[nl]following the path of girls with glasses, Ruri!
RUR/RUR0005460
I don't care. What an annoying desire....
RUR/RUR0005470
If you like glasses so much, why not pray to a god?[nl]Like you said earlier.
SYU/SYU0004730
Like "God, please make everyone wear glasses"?[nl]That's good.
RAK/RAK0031780
What kind of god would grant such a stupid wish?
OTM/OTM0001960
Thy wish has been granted!
RAK/RAK0031790
Huh?
RUR/RUR0005480
What is it, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0031800
Er, didn't you hear that just now?[nl]That ominous whisper....
SYU/SYU0004740
No, I didn't hear anything.[nl]Maybe you misheard?
RAK/RAK0031810
Then again, it sounded like a voice I've heard somewhere.....[nl]Hmmm....I have a bad feeling about this.
RUR/RUR0005490
A bad feeling, huh.
RUR/RUR0005500
Well, if my friend was a pervert who couldn't stop[nl]yelling "glasses, glasses" all the time,[nl]I suppose I'd have a pretty bad feeling, too.
SYU/SYU0004750
T-That's horrible, Ruri.
RUR/RUR0005510
I don't care to get involved with this many idiots.[nl]I'm going home.
SYU/SYU0004760
Well, we should probably be headed back too, Raku.
RAK/RAK0031820
S-Sure.
RAK/RAK0031830
(Hmmmm......[nl] I know I've heard that voice from somewhere.....)
OTM/OTM0001970

RAK/RAK0031850
Heey, you guys, are you up?
RYU/RYU0000730
Oh, young master.[nl]Good morni---
RYU/RYU0000740
Y-Y-Y-Y-Young master![nl]What the hell is that!?
RAK/RAK0031860
What the hell is....what?[nl]Is there something on my face?
RYU/RYU0000750
No, the problem is that somethin' ISN'T on your face![nl]Young master, where's yer glasses!?
RAK/RAK0031870
Glasses....?
RAK/RAK0031880
Actually, you guys all seem to be[nl]wearing glasses this morning.
RAK/RAK0031890
Haha, cut it out, cut it out.[nl]Pretending to be intellectuals[nl]doesn't suit you guys at all.
RYU/RYU0000760
Huh? What're ya talkin' about, young master!?[nl]People wear glasses when they go out in public, don't they?
RAK/RAK0031900
Huh? How come? Even if their eyesight isn't bad?
RYU/RYU0000770
Why, well....[nl]Because that's normal, of course!
RYU/RYU0000780
Even though we're in a rather underground line of work,[nl]we can't just go walking around without our glasses!
RAK/RAK0031910
Huh....?
RYU/RYU0000790
Here, don't slouch, young master,[nl]and put these glasses on quick!
RAK/RAK0031920
Oh, hey! What the hell are you doing!?
RYU/RYU0000800
Alright! Yer all good to go!
RAK/RAK0031930
Huh? Are these lensless glasses?
RYU/RYU0000810
Indeed they are.[nl]Young master, please don't go to school without[nl]yer glasses, alright?
RAK/RAK0031940
(Jeez, I don't get it.[nl] What the hell is Ryuu on about?)
RAK/RAK0031950
(....This is so weird.[nl] It's definitely very weird.)
RAK/RAK0031960
(And it's not just our guys, either.[nl] Office workers going to work, housewives talking,[nl] little kids, old people, everyone's wearing glasses.)
RAK/RAK0031970
(The humans are bad enough....[nl] But why the hell are roadside statues[nl] and stray animals all wearing glasses, too!?)
CTG/CTG0009820
G'morning, Raku.
RAK/RAK0031980
....Y-Yo.
CTG/CTG0009830
Huh? Why do you look so grumpy this early?
RAK/RAK0031990
Of course you're wearing glasses too, Chitoge.
@expose
CTG/CTG0009840
Huh? Well, of course I'm wearing glasses.[nl]Isn't that basic social ettiquete for a human?
RAK/RAK0032000
Social ettiquete....?
RAK/RAK0032010
I mean, Ryuu was doing the same thing.[nl]Why are they all acting like it's normal to wear glasses?
RAK/RAK0032020
I mean, you weren't even wearing glasses until today.
CTG/CTG0009850
Huh? What are you talking about?[nl]I never take off my glasses in public.[nl]There's no way I could do something so vulgar.
RAK/RAK0032030
Eh....?[nl]No, I've never seen you with glasses before today.
RAK/RAK0032040
What are you talking about?[nl]I have no idea....
CTG/CTG0009860
I'm the one who has no idea.[nl]What the hell is with you today?
RAK/RAK0032050
It's possible that you, my guys, and everyone in town[nl]are setting me up for some kind of prank.
CTG/CTG0009870
H-Hang on, what's the matter, Raku?[nl]You're mumbling to yourself.
RAK/RAK0032060
Anyway, there's no way I'm taking part in this farce.
Take off your own glasses
Take off Chitoge's glasses
RAK/RAK0032070
What's even the point of wearing these?[nl]I'm taking them off.
CTG/CTG0009880
Wha....!?
RAK/RAK0032080

A-A-A-A-Are you some kind of idiot!?[nl]You're a pervert, for taking off your glasses and showing[nl]yourself right in the middle of the street! Flasher!
RAK/RAK0032100
H-Hey, hey, what's the matter?[nl]You're taking the joke too far to be treating me like[nl]a pervert for taking off my gl----

Don't come near me![nl]Perverted bean sprooooout!
RAK/RAK0032110
Stop cracking jokes and take off your glasses.
CTG/CTG0009920
Huh?
RAK/RAK0032120
Here, see? You're way better off without them.[nl]It's not like you're some kind of stoic chairman chara--

Hmph! That's absolutely disgusting![nl]I didn't think you were that shameless!

No matter how much we're fake lovers,[nl]you don't know where to draw the line!?
CTG/CTG0009990
I don't care anymore![nl]I'm going to school alone, so don't follow me!
RAK/RAK0032180

CTG/CTG0010000

(Owww.....my cheek's still burning....[nl] She used every ounce of her brute strength....!)
RAK/RAK0032210
(But....even here at school,[nl] everyone's wearing glasses, as far as the eye can see....)
RAK/RAK0032220
(I don't have a clue what's going on,[nl] but anyway, am I allowed to take off my glasses today?)
CTG/CTG0010010
Mrgh....
RAK/RAK0032230
Oh, Chitoge.
RAK/RAK0032240
Uh, umm, about what happened earlier....
CTG/CTG0010020
Nope! I don't care![nl]I'm not talking to any perverted bean sprouts!
RAK/RAK0032250
(Dammit. She's completely shut me down....[nl] She doesn't have a clue what I'm talking about.)
SYU/SYU0004770
....Hey, Raku. Got a sec?
RUR/RUR0005520
Good morning, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0032260
Oh, Shuu and Miyamoto.[nl]Your glasses don't look out of place, at least.
SYU/SYU0004780
Well, that's just because we always wear them.
RUR/RUR0005530
Judging by your reaction, and the bruise on your cheek,[nl]you don't seem terribly comfortable with this situation, either.
RAK/RAK0032270
!![nl]You mean....you guys are sane, too?
SYU/SYU0004790
Let's talk about it on the rooftop.[nl]It'd be better if these guys didn't hear.
RAK/RAK0032280
....I see. So you guys woke up[nl]and found yourselves in the same situation.
RAK/RAK0032290
Thank goodness. I'm glad I'm not[nl]the only one who feels this way.
RUR/RUR0005540
This morning's been full of surprises.[nl]Everywhere I turn, it's glasses, glasses, glasses....
SYU/SYU0004800
Even all the reporters on TV were wearing glasses~.
RUR/RUR0005550
I flipped through my history textbook earlier[nl]and all the pictures of historical figures have glasses as well.
SYU/SYU0004810
It's so weird to see Prince Shotoku[nl]and Genghis Khan with glasses.
RUR/RUR0005560
It's almost like glasses rule the whole world....[nl]It makes me think the moral system has changed to the[nl]point that taking off your glasses is a sin.
RAK/RAK0032300
Taking off your glasses is bad, huh....
SYU/SYU0004820
It seems to me like taking off your glasses in public[nl]is as embarrassing as being completely naked in public now.
RAK/RAK0032310
I see. So that's why Chitoge beat me up this morning.
RAK/RAK0032320
I think I understand the situation a little more....[nl]But how did everyone come to believe that?[nl]Only the three of us are normal....
SYU/SYU0004830
Hmmm....now that I think about it,[nl]maybe it's because of that thing at the shrine.
RAK/RAK0032330
That thing?
SYU/SYU0004840
Ya know, yesterday, when we were out in front[nl]of the old shrine talking about girls with glasses[nl]and how I admire them?
SYU/SYU0004850
I said something like "wouldn't it be great if[nl]everyone wore glasses."
SYU/SYU0004860
Maybe a god heard what I said,[nl]and that's why things turned out like this.
RAK/RAK0032340
Hahaha. I don't see how that's possible, Shuu.
RUR/RUR0005570
Exactly. It's ludicrous to think that the world[nl]could change this much from such silly mutterings.
SYU/SYU0004870
Hmmmm, but it makes sense when[nl]you think about it that way.
SYU/SYU0004880
We're the only three people who feel uncomfortable[nl]in this world full of glasses, right?
SYU/SYU0004890
Maybe because we were all at the shrine when the[nl]wish was made, we got spared from everyone's[nl]adjustment of values.
RUR/RUR0005580
So what? Are you saying the world went wrong[nl]because of your delusion?
RUR/RUR0005590
Top-tier stupid.[nl]The very definition of delusional.
SYU/SYU0004900
Is that so?[nl]I don't think my theory's impossible....
RUR/RUR0005600
No way, it's completely impossible.[nl]If such a god exists, I'd love to see proof.
OTM/OTM0001990
I hath the proof right here.
RUR/RUR0005610
RUR/RUR0005620
W-Who is this girl!?[nl]When did she get here!?
SYU/SYU0004910
Oh, you're not wearing glasses, either?
RUR/RUR0005630
Forget that, you've got ears and a tail and stuff![nl]What is this, cosplay!?
RAK/RAK0032350
Otama! What are you doing here!?
OTM/OTM0002000
Well, I am an Inari-sama who cometh and goeth as I please.[nl]I only showed myself here because there art ignorant people[nl]whomst would deign to deny my existence!
SYU/SYU0004920
Huh? What's this?[nl]Raku, do you know her?
RAK/RAK0032360
Uhh....I was trying to keep this a secret....[nl]But it can't be helped now. Truth is.....
SYU/SYU0004930G
Inari-sama!?
RUR/RUR0005650
What, so you really are a god?
OTM/OTM0002010
I'm a youkai, to be precise.[nl]I am still in training to become a full-fledged "Sacred Fox".
OTM/OTM0002020
Watch!
RUR/RUR0005660
!!
RUR/RUR0005670
Well?
RUR/RUR0005680
I don't believe it....[nl]But, surely, this isn't human work....
SYU/SYU0004940
Oho, Ruri, you god-denier,[nl]you finally believe me?
RUR/RUR0005690
Whether or not I do believe it,[nl]if it happens right before my very eyes....
RUR/RUR0005700
So this glasses-world is your work, as well?
RUR/RUR0005710
Verily. Granting wishes is my mission and my training.[nl]That is why I granted thy wish.
RUR/RUR0005720
Hehehe....I have filled the whole world with glasses.[nl]By my hand, everyone in the world will endure[nl]"un-bear-a-ble shame" without their glasses.
RAK/RAK0032370
S-Seriously....?
RAK/RAK0032390
You really are a powerful youkai!
RUR/RUR0005730
Haha, is it not great?[nl]Wonderful, perhaps? Thou shouldst be grateful!
RUR/RUR0005740
Bwahahahaha!
SYU/SYU0004950
Ummmm, Earth to Miss Fox?
SYU/SYU0004960
I appreciate the thought, but isn't this a bit much?[nl]If everyone's wearing glasses, it doesn't mean[nl]anything anymore.[nl]There's no scarcity value.
RUR/RUR0005750
Indeed.... Not that I give a crap what Maiko says,[nl]but this world where everyone's wearing glasses is too[nl]abnormal to live in. Please change everyone back.
OTM/OTM0002080
What's wrong with thee?[nl]I hath granted thy wish, and now thou wisheth[nl]immediately for me to undo it?
RAK/RAK0032400
Well, naturally.[nl]We didn't want the world to be like this in the first place.
OTM/OTM0002090
Good grief. Humans are selfish.
RAK/RAK0032410
Whatever, just fix it.
OTM/OTM0002100
Hmmm....'tis not that simple.[nl]Things cannot be rushed back.
SYU/SYU0004970
OTM/OTM0002110
Well, as I hath said, I have divine power to spare....[nl]But for this wish, I would need to use all of it.
OTM/OTM0002120
'Tis not so easy to unlock, either.[nl]There is a certain procedure....
RAK/RAK0032420
Procedure? What is it?
OTM/OTM0002130
Simply put, thou must give up with thine own hands[nl]the desire that was the source of the wish.
OTM/OTM0002140
"Cutting off worldly desires", one might say.
RUR/RUR0005760
Cutting off worldly desires, huh....
RUR/RUR0005770
If this situation was born from a worldly desire[nl]for girls with glasses, then it will go back to normal[nl]if we do something about that desire?
OTM/OTM0002150
Mhm. Thou art quick on the uptake.
OTM/OTM0002160
More specifically, thou must rip off the glasses[nl]of the people around thee.
RAK/RAK0032430
Huh? What do you mean "rip off their glasses"!?
OTM/OTM0002170
I hath turned thy desire to "see the people[nl]around thee wearing glasses" into a reality.
OTM/OTM0002180
Then, to remove the glasses from those[nl]closest to thee is proof enough that thou[nl]hast broken free of thy worldly desire.
RAK/RAK0032440
I see. I kind of understand the logic....
SYU/SYU0004980
But wouldn't that be pretty hard?
SYU/SYU0004990
Everyone's super shy about taking off their glasses.[nl]They probably wouldn't, even if we asked them.
RAK/RAK0032450
Yeah. And if you force them off,[nl]they treat you like a criminal....
RUR/RUR0005780
By the way, how many people do we need[nl]to take glasses off of?
OTM/OTM0002190
Let me see....[nl]I thinketh that if thou removeth seven people's glasses,[nl]thy desires will be removed.
RAK/RAK0032460
Seven, huh....that's quite a few.
SYU/SYU0005000
Oh, Miss Fox.[nl]If we take off our own glasses, would that count,[nl]since we're close to ourselves?
OTM/OTM0002200
Well, I suppose that's alright.[nl]It can be anyone close to thee,[nl]as long as they're wearing glasses.
SYU/SYU0005010
Alright. I think we can manage this.[nl]If we're three people already, we just need four more.
RAK/RAK0032470
Okay, let's just take ours off for now....
RUR/RUR0005790
Okay.
SYU/SYU0005020
Sure.
RAK/RAK0032480
(Hm....?)
SYU/SYU0005030
Umm.....?
RUR/RUR0005800
What....?
RAK/RAK0032490
(What's going on?[nl] Somehow, this feels immoral....)
SYU/SYU0005040
....H-hey. What's the matter, Raku?[nl]Why don't you take off your glasses?
RUR/RUR0005810
You're the one who stopped taking off[nl]your glasses, Maiko.
RAK/RAK0032500
You're one to talk, Miyamoto....
OTM/OTM0002210
Mhm. It would seem the wish is gradually taking[nl]effect on all of thee, as well.
RUR/RUR0005820
Then this strange embarrassment[nl]at the prospect of taking of my glasses....
RAK/RAK0032510
Does this mean the wish is starting to affect us?
SYU/SYU0005050
Huh? Well, that's not good. If we can't even[nl]take off our own glasses, much less other people's,[nl]that's the end of the line right there.
RUR/RUR0005830
T-That's right. I know that in my head, but....
OTM/OTM0002220
Better move fast if you want to outrun the wish.
OTM/OTM0002230
By sundown, like everyone else, all three of thee[nl]will find it impossible to bear the thought of[nl]taking off your glasses.
RAK/RAK0032520
So the time-limit is until evening....
SYU/SYU0005060
There's no time to lose.[nl]Alright, Raku. I'm gonna take the plunge[nl]and take these off....
SYU/SYU0005070
Tchaaaaaa!
RAK/RAK0032530
Whoa! That was surprisingly manly, Shuu!
RUR/RUR0005840
W-Wait, Maiko![nl]What did you just take off!?
SYU/SYU0005080
Well, it's.....[nl]It couldn't be helped. This is a special case.
RUR/RUR0005850
I-I know! I know that, but....!
SYU/SYU0005090
Well then, let's get Ruri's off as well.[nl]Together.
RUR/RUR0005860
D-D-D-Don't come near me![nl]Don't get any closer to me with your glasses off!
SYU/SYU0005100
Ohh.....Ruri![nl]Where are you going!
RUR/RUR0005870
I-I'm going to separate from you guys for a while![nl]See you!
SYU/SYU0005110
R-Ruri!?
RAK/RAK0032540
For Miyamoto, it's like you[nl]suddenly got naked in front of her.
SYU/SYU0005120
Yeah, I guess so....[nl]She's treating me like a pervert,[nl]and that's kinda hard for me to deal with.
SYU/SYU0005130
Raku! You gotta--
RAK/RAK0032550
I know. I'm not running away!
RAK/RAK0032560
....But if I'm this embarrassed,[nl]it's kinda hard to set my mind to it.
OTM/OTM0002240
It's fine. Thou art both men, so just take them off![nl]What need is there to be bashful around another man!?
RAK/RAK0032570
No, it's more that you're here.[nl]I don't feel like exposing myself in front of a little girl.
SYU/SYU0005140
....Raku, don't worry about it so much.[nl]That's a false sense of shame.
RAK/RAK0032590
Yeah, I know, but....
SYU/SYU0005150
If you can't do it, how about I take them off for you?
RAK/RAK0032600
Huh?
SYU/SYU0005160
Whaaat, you'll get used to it once you take them off.[nl]Here, turn you head this way.
RAK/RAK0032610
H-Hey! Stop it, Shuu![nl]Don't try to force them off!
SYU/SYU0005170
This is all so that we can restore this world to its[nl]original state! You're just wasting time by resisting!
RAK/RAK0032620
It's fine! I can do it, I can do it![nl]I can do it myself!
SYU/SYU0005180
No need to be so shy.[nl]Just relax your shoulders, Raku!
KSK/KSK0008310
Ichijo~, Maiko~![nl]It's time for--
KSK/KSK0008320
....home....room....?
RAK/RAK0032630
SYU/SYU0005190
Oh.
KSK/KSK0008330
I-Ichijo and Maiko are hugging each other[nl]and taking off each other's glasses....
KSK/KSK0008340
Ah....hahahahaha......
RAK/RAK0032640
H-Hey, wait, Onodera![nl]You're probably grossly misunderstanding the situation!
KSK/KSK0008350
I-I'm sorry, Ichijo![nl]I didn't know you two had that kind of relationship!
KSK/KSK0008360
D-Don't worry, I'll tell the teacher....![nl]Umm, what should I say....
@expose2
KSK/KSK0008370
I-I'm happy for you!
RAK/RAK0032650
O-Onoderaaaaa! No! You're wrong!
KSK/KSK0008380
.....Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah![nl]I don't know! I didn't see anythiiiing!
......
SYU/SYU0005200
Ahahahaha....[nl]She completely misunderstood us....
RAK/RAK0032660
It's all over....[nl]My high school days are all over....
SYU/SYU0005210
Hey, it'll be okay![nl]If we can fix this glasses-world problem,[nl]wouldn't that clear up Onodera's misunderstanding?
RAK/RAK0032670
Yeah, you're right....[nl]I've got to bank everything on that possibility....
RAK/RAK0032680
I'll do whatever it takes to fix this world![nl]Even if it costs me....my dignity!
SYU/SYU0005220
Oho....! Raku, you took off your own glasses!
RAK/RAK0032690
I won't hesitate anymore![nl]I'm gonna rip off everyone's glasses!
OTM/OTM0002250
Well, I liketh the enthusiasm, gentlemen. But would it not[nl]be prudent to keep thy glasses on for the time being?
RAK/RAK0032700
OTM/OTM0002260
Because, without thy glasses, thou wouldst[nl]appear as lecherous ruffians in this world.
RAK/RAK0032710
T-That's right. Even if we negotiate with people to remove[nl]their glasses, someone might call the police on us[nl]if we don't wear ours....
SYU/SYU0005230
We have to go to class.[nl]Let's wait until lunch break and then start operating.
@ＢＧＭ停止
@フェードアウト
RAK/RAK0032720
(Thus began the spectacular spectacle hunt[nl] for world order at the expense of my dignity.)
RAK/RAK0032730
(We only need to get five more pairs.[nl] Let's see whose we can take off first....)
