Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0055000
Waaagh! What's with the sudden yelling?
SSR/SSR0014540
I....I need some life advice from you![nl]Follow me for a minute!
RAK/RAK0055010
Life advice? You want mine?
@ＢＧＭ再生
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0055020
So, what is this life advice?
SSR/SSR0014550
Listen....don't tell the Mistress this yet.[nl]I don't want to surprise her too much.
RAK/RAK0055030
Would it really be that much of a surprise to her?
SSR/SSR0014560
Honestly, I'm still a little shaken by it.[nl]No way....
SSR/SSR0014570
There's no way I was expecting my own parents to show up!
RAK/RAK0055040
Y-Your parents!? But I thought you were--
@expose
SSR/SSR0014580
Yes. Master Claude took me in back in America.[nl]I don't even remember my parents faces.
SSR/SSR0014590
But then I received a message.
@ＢＧＭ停止
SSR/SSR0014600
An email with the subject line[nl]"Mr. Yamamoto requested that I look for his daughter"!
......
RAK/RAK0055050
Huh....?
@ＢＧＭ再生
SSR/SSR0014610
Apparently my real last name is "Yamamoto".
SSR/SSR0014620
Moreover, he appears to be a big landowner where he lives. When he took me on a business trip abroad, we got[nl]separated, and he has been looking for me ever since.
SSR/SSR0014630
That's not all that was in the email.[nl]My father is also sick and doesn't have long to live.
SSR/SSR0014640
Since he doesn't have any other living relatives,[nl]he wants me to go meet him. He also wants me to[nl]inherit his estate and take over the family.
SSR/SSR0014650
Raku Ichijo! What should I do here!?[nl]I'd hate to leave the Mistress's side, but....[nl]Should I go meet my father?
RAK/RAK0055060
....The inheritance is about a billion yen, right?[nl]They're requesting 1.2 million yen to process it?
SSR/SSR0014660
Huh....? H-How did you know that?
RAK/RAK0055070
I got something yesterday, too. From Mr. Yamamoto.[nl]He's looking for a son-in-law for his daughter.
SSR/SSR0014670
Whaaat!? T-That can't be right!
RAK/RAK0055080
Yeah, of course--
SSR/SSR0014680
My father wants you to be his son-in-law!?[nl]T-T-T-T-T-That can't be right! This is too sudden,[nl]and what would I tell the Mistress!?
RAK/RAK0055090
No! Those emails are just junk mail!
SSR/SSR0014690
Huh? Junk mail?
RAK/RAK0055100
You gotta be kidding. I didn't think anyone would[nl]fall for a scam like that....and yet here you are.
SSR/SSR0014700
W-What did they do to me?[nl]And also, what is junk mail....?
RAK/RAK0055110
Ahh, so that's where you're coming from....[nl]Listen, junk mail is....
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0055120
.....So basically, you almost sent your money to a scammer.
SSR/SSR0014710
I-I see....[nl]I almost got scammed....
SSR/SSR0014720
Hahahaha, it makes sense now.[nl]After all, how could I find my real parents so easily?[nl]Hahaha, haha....
RAK/RAK0055130
(Hmmmm, she looks depressed....)
RAK/RAK0055170
Here, have some of these to cheer you up.
SSR/SSR0014750
These are....?
RAK/RAK0055180
Something sweet should cheer you up. Go ahead.
RAK/RAK0055190
I really wish I could do something more fancy....
SSR/SSR0014760
....Heh. I've fallen far to be pitied by you.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・大
SSR/SSR0014770
But, nonetheless, thank you very much.
SSR/SSR0014780
Yes....they're good.
RAK/RAK0055200
(Is she feeling a bit better?)
RAK/RAK0055140
Hey, don't feel so down about it.[nl]....Wait, that's not something I can[nl]just say so lightly.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
@expose2
SSR/SSR0014730
I'm sorry....but I don't require sympathy.[nl]Rather, I am ashamed at my own ignorance,[nl]nearly being deceived by such a scam.
SSR/SSR0014740
Rest assured the Beehive will do everything in our power[nl]to identify the sender of that email and make them regret[nl]doing such a thing with every fiber of their being!
RAK/RAK0055150
....Well, don't go killing them.
RAK/RAK0055160
(At least she's more positive now, right?)
