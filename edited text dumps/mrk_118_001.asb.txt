...So yeah, Kosaki![nl]That puppy on TV last night was soooo cute!
KSK/KSK0018220
Oooh, really?[nl]I missed it, I was in the bath at the time.
CTG/CTG0023430
Hahaha, you take super long baths, Kosaki.
KSK/KSK0018230
Awww. That's not true.
MRK/MRK0014580
Mghh....[nl]Kirisaki's talking to Onodera again.
MRK/MRK0014590
But I also wanted to talk to her.
RAK/RAK0077700
Hm? Then you can just go up and talk to her, no worries.
@expose
MRK/MRK0014600
But when Kirisaki's around, it's far too easy to start fighting.[nl]I'll talk to Onodera at a more peaceful time.
RAK/RAK0077710
Ohh, I didn't think you cared about that sort of thing.[nl]I'm surprised you care that much.
MRK/MRK0014610
Of course I do, Raku dearest.[nl]What kind of person did you take me for?
RAK/RAK0077720
W-Well.... I mean....[nl]Hahaha....
RAK/RAK0077730
(How can I say that I've only seen her taking an interest[nl] in me and that she doesn't seem to have many friends....?)
RAK/RAK0077740
But I really don't think you need to worry[nl]about that at all.
MRK/MRK0014620
Yes, I do.
MRK/MRK0014630
Whenever I open my mouth around her, we always[nl]end up fighting over you, so we just don't get along[nl]at all.
RAK/RAK0077750
Maybe if you were a little more mature,[nl]it would be easier to get along with her....
MRK/MRK0014640
Raku dearest. You can't make the most of your youth[nl]by just sitting around. You gotta fight and earn it!
RAK/RAK0077760
But your fighting is gonna get me caught in the crossfire!
MRK/MRK0014650
But it's not as though I really like fighting either!
MRK/MRK0014660
First of all, it's like I *dislike* Kirisaki, per se.
RAK/RAK0077770
Huh? Really?
MRK/MRK0014670
She's a foul-mouthed, short-tempered woman who isn't[nl]feminine in the slightest, and yet she has the audacity[nl]to call herself your girlfriend.
........
MRK/MRK0014680
....But over the last few months,[nl]I've discovered that she's not really a bad person.
MRK/MRK0014690
If only she wasn't dating you, Raku dearest,[nl]we might actually be able to be friends.
RAK/RAK0077780
I didn't think you thought about her that way.[nl]Chitoge would be so surprised.
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0014700
Well, that's just a "what-if" scenario....
MRK/MRK0014710
Currently, I don't like Kirisaki one bit,[nl]and the feeling is mutual.
MRK/MRK0014720
We are sworn rivals. Our battle is far from over!
RAK/RAK0077790
Please just stop battling....
