Raku Ichijooo!!
RAK/RAK0015690
Aaah! Tsugumi![nl]W-What's the matter!?
SSR/SSR0001690
...I have a favor to ask of you,[nl]as the mistress's boyfriend.
RAK/RAK0015700
Huh....?
CTG/CTG0008030
Huh? Tsugumi, what's wrong?[nl]What is it you need from Raku?
@expose
SSR/SSR0001700
Aa! M-Mistress!
SSR/SSR0001710
Khh....we can't talk here.[nl]Raku Ichijo! Shut up and come with me!
@叫び揺れ
RAK/RAK0015710
H-Hey! Stop pulling me!
@pan
RAK/RAK0015720
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!
CTG/CTG0008040
Hm?

RAK/RAK0015730
---So, I shut up and came with you, but....[nl]This is an aquarium, right?
SSR/SSR0001720
Yes, an aquarium.
RAK/RAK0015740
You....wanted to come to an aquarium with me?
SSR/SSR0001730
I have a good reason![nl]Hear me out!
SSR/SSR0001740
....Ahem.
SSR/SSR0001750
This aquarium has a limited edition[nl]stuffed animal that the mistress wants.
SSR/SSR0001760
As for me, I'd like to get her one[nl]as a token of my appreciation of her....
SSR/SSR0001770
But I heard that to get this particular stuffed animal,[nl]you need to attend the event as a pair.
RAK/RAK0015760
Hmmhmm.[nl]That sounds like it'll be a lot of trouble.
SSR/SSR0001780
You say that like it's someone else's problem....[nl]You're going to be in the event with me!
RAK/RAK0015770
Huh!? Me....with you!?
SSR/SSR0001790
T-There's no need to act so surprised.
RAK/RAK0015780
N-No, it's just....[nl]There's all kinds of guys in the Beehive, right?
RAK/RAK0015790
Wouldn't it have been easier to just[nl]have one of them go with you instead?
SSR/SSR0001800
No. I can't trust them to[nl]not let word slip to the mistress.
SSR/SSR0001810
Claude is the only one I trust to keep quiet....[nl]But I don't think I can ask him....
RAK/RAK0015800
I see. So that's where I come in.
SSR/SSR0001820
It annoys me that I have to rely on you,[nl]but that's a small price to pay to see the joy[nl]on the mistress's face.
RAK/RAK0015810
By the way, what would you do if I said no?
SSR/SSR0001830
Impossible. As the mistress's boyfriend,[nl]isn't it natural that you'd go right along with this?
RAK/RAK0015820
Gwehh...![nl]So I don't have a say right from the get-go!
SSR/SSR0001840
Of course! If you're really the[nl]mistress's lover, you'd nod your head yes immediately![nl]Right!?
RAK/RAK0015830
Yeah, you're right.[nl]I'll do it, then.
RAK/RAK0015840
So, this event. What is it?
SSR/SSR0001850
I dunno.[nl]All I know is that they require male-female pairs.
RAK/RAK0015850
Huh? Male-female?
RAK/RAK0015860
----
RAK/RAK0015870
Hey, Tsugumi.[nl]Doesn't it feel like there's[nl]an unusual amount of couples around?
SSR/SSR0001860
Hm?
......
SSR/SSR0001870
It would seem so, but why does that matter?
RAK/RAK0015880
I'm just saying, this event might be....
EVS/EVS0000010
Registration will close shortly.[nl]If you are participating in the event,[nl]please gather around here as soon as possible!
SSR/SSR0001880
Let's go! We don't have time!
RAK/RAK0015890
Wa- He- Stop pulling me![nl]Hear me out!
@ＢＧＭ停止
SSR/SSR0001890
Our first mission is....[nl]"Find something heart-shaped on the[nl]bottom of the ocean floor", huh.
SSR/SSR0001900
Khh....I can't see anything heart-shaped.[nl]There's too many fish to see clearly!
RAK/RAK0015900
Well, yeah, this is an aquarium.[nl]Of course there's lots of fish.
SSR/SSR0001910
I knew that already![nl]More importantly, are you even trying to[nl]find it yourself!?
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0001920
I feel like it's over there somewhere....[nl]Lemme see it!
RAK/RAK0015910
Oy! Don't lean on me so much!
SSR/SSR0001930
I can't see it if I don't do this.
SSR/SSR0001940
Aah....!?
SSR/SSR0001950
There it is, Raku Ichijo!
SSR/SSR0001960
Haha....whatever that is, it's surprisingly cute.[nl]It's shining there in the water as the lights reflect[nl]off of it!
RAK/RAK0015920
(Hmmm... I guess she does[nl] have a feminine side after all.[nl] She seems pretty happy....)
RAK/RAK0015930
(But it kinda looks like that's[nl] just a heart-shaped rock....)
SSR/SSR0001970
Hahaha. I wish I could show this to the mistress.
@フェードアウト
SSR/SSR0001980
Right, this is our next mission!
ASK/ASK0000010
Arf, arf, arf!
RAK/RAK0015940
The Sea Lion Couple High Five, huh....
SSR/SSR0001990
Hehe....this should be simple.[nl]Here, come here.
ASK/ASK0000020
Arf, arf, arf ♪
SSR/SSR0002000
Yes, yes. Good boy. Now! High five!
RAK/RAK0015950
Hey~! Nice job, Tsugumi!
RAK/RAK0015960
Alright, my turn....[nl]Right! Come here!
ASK/ASK0000030
Arrrrrrrr~~~!
RAK/RAK0015970
Gwah!? Cold!
SSR/SSR0002010
Hyahh!?
ASK/ASK0000040
Bark, bark!?[nl]Arf, arf, arf!
RAK/RAK0015980
Dammit, even here, animals don't seem to like me....
RAK/RAK0015990
Are you alright, Tsugumi?
RAK/RAK0016000
Hey, aaaagh! You're soaked!
@expose2
SSR/SSR0002020
Whaaaaaa!?[nl]D-Don't look at me!
@ＨＰ－１０
RAK/RAK0016010
Gwaahhh!?
RAK/RAK0016020
Owww....
SSR/SSR0002030
Fwah....we're finally all dry.[nl]Jeez....we lost a lot of time.
RAK/RAK0016030
Yeah, yeah, sorry, that was all my fault.
SSR/SSR0002040
Hmph. I didn't expect even sea lions to hate you.[nl]How are you supposed to be a keeper like that?
RAK/RAK0016040
Please don't say that.[nl]It seriously stings...
SSR/SSR0002050
I-I see....sorry.
RAK/RAK0016050
Anyway! I managed to touch his flipper once,[nl]so I guess this mission is complete, right?
SSR/SSR0002060
Yeah. I got the O.K. from the staff just now.
SSR/SSR0002070
Alright, next!
SSR/SSR0002080
This way next!
SSR/SSR0002090
Next! Hurry up!
SSR/SSR0002100
Next!
RAK/RAK0016060
Hahh....hahh....
SSR/SSR0002110
Alright. This is our next and final mission.
RAK/RAK0016070
Finally....
RAK/RAK0016080
We chased penguins,[nl]we caught a lucky tropical fish....[nl]That was a lot of work.
SSR/SSR0002120
This is all for the mistress. Stop whining.
SSR/SSR0002130
If something this trivial upsets you,[nl]then you're not qualified to be her lover!
RAK/RAK0016090
Right, right....sorry about that.
RAK/RAK0016100
So, what's the last mission?
SSR/SSR0002140
I don't know.[nl]I was told the staff would explain it....
EVS/EVS0000020
Alright~, boyfriends and girlfriends![nl]Thank you for participating in our event today!
SSR/SSR0002150
Hm....?
EVS/EVS0000030
So, for those lucky couples who completed[nl]our other challenges, please listen as I explain[nl]today's final challenge!
SSR/SSR0002160
Hey, Raku Ichijo....[nl]Just now, did she say...."boyfriends and girlfriends"?
RAK/RAK0016110
Yeah. That's what she said....
EVS/EVS0000040
Yes, let's go! If you can finish this challenge,[nl]you will win a special stuffed animal that's[nl]exclusive to this aquarium!
EVS/EVS0000050
This event is called:[nl]"All Living Creatures Show Their Love Through Hugs!?[nl]Heart-Pounding ★ Couple Hugging!"
EVS/EVS0000060
That's right! Now, let us see your warm embraces!
SSR/SSR0002170
Wha....!

@画面揺らし2
SSR/SSR0002190
WHAT THE HELLL!?
RAK/RAK0016120
H-Hey, Tsugumi.[nl]I didn't really want to think about this....[nl]But this is a special couples-only dating event!
SSR/SSR0002200
D-Dating event!?
SSR/SSR0002210
W-W-W-W-Wait! Hang on, Raku Ichijo![nl]I didn't know about any of this!
SSR/SSR0002220
T-T-This is just a mission to get[nl]something for the mistress![nl]I had no idea it was this kind of event!
RAK/RAK0016130
C-Calm down![nl]I understand, so don't worry.
SSR/SSR0002230
Ghhhh......
EVS/EVS0000070
Heey you, that high school couple over there![nl]If you don't hug soon,[nl]you won't get the stuffed animal, okay?
RAK/RAK0016140
High school couple....[nl]Is she talking to us!?
RAK/RAK0016150
W-Well....[nl]We can't just hug each other. Right, Tsugumi---
SSR/SSR0002240
Ooooohhhhhh.....
RAK/RAK0016160
T-Tsugumi!?!?
SSR/SSR0002250
....Guhh! We've come all this way,[nl]and now we have to return....empty handed!?
SSR/SSR0002260
W-We're doing this! Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0016170
Huh!? Seriously!? Hugging!?[nl]You mean, like, an actual hug!?
SSR/SSR0002270
There's no need to say it twice! Idiot!
SSR/SSR0002280
This is all for the sake of the mistress.[nl]I've resigned myself, so you should too!
RAK/RAK0016180
B-But.....
SSR/SSR0002290
Stop complaining already....[nl]Well, c-come on!
RAK/RAK0016190
W-We're seriously doing this!?
