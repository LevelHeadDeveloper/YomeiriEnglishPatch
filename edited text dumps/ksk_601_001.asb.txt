I-Ichijo....[nl]Sorry for calling you all the way out here....
RAK/RAK0011560
N-No.....It's fine, alright?[nl]Sorry for keeping you waiting.
RAK/RAK0011570
(It isn't okay at all! [nl] My legs are shaking and wobbling something awful!)
KSK/KSK0005210
No, I wasn't waiting too long.[nl]I'm just....so happy that you came.
RAK/RAK0011580
I-Is that so....?
KSK/KSK0005220
.....Yes. I'm very, very happy.[nl]I kept thinking you might not come.
RAK/RAK0011590
T-That's not true at all![nl]To not come, even when you ask me to, Onodera....[nl]There's no way I'd do that.
KSK/KSK0005230
.....That's true.[nl]That's the kind of person you are, Ichijo.
KSK/KSK0005240
I always knew you were that kind of boy....
RAK/RAK0011600
Eeh....?

RAK/RAK0011610
(C-Crap....[nl] I'm so nervous, my heart is[nl] beating pretty loud....)
RAK/RAK0011620
(I knew I'd be pretty nervous....[nl] Even if this is just small talk,[nl] I'll be pretty happy....!)

Wait for Kosaki to finish
Confess your feelings
KSK/KSK0005270
Ummmm....[nl]There's something I've been meaning to tell you[nl]for a long time.
KSK/KSK0005280
Ichijo![nl]For a long time, I---
RAK/RAK0011640
....Wait a sec.
KSK/KSK0005290
Ehh?
RAK/RAK0011650
I might be jumping the gun a little here....
RAK/RAK0011660
If you end up telling me[nl]the same thing I wanted to tell you,[nl]I'm going to regret it so much....
RAK/RAK0011670
So, may I say it first?

That was lightning! He got struck by lightning!
KSK/KSK0005330
Kyahhh!　Ichijo!!　A-A-Are you alright!?!?
RAK/RAK0011720
(W-W-What the hell!?)
RAK/RAK0011730
(First those chimes, then Ryuu and the others,[nl] Then even Onodera's cell phone ringing....)
RAK/RAK0011740
(I thought she was finally going to confess,[nl] but we were interrupted by a direct hit[nl] from a bolt of lightning this time~~!!)
RAK/RAK0011750
(I thought I'd finally be able to confess,[nl] but we were interrupted by a direct hit[nl] from a bolt of lightning this time~~!!)

Hello, Ichijo?[nl]Why are you whispering?
KSK/KSK0005360
I see....You had some urgent business.
KSK/KSK0005370
Okay, got it.....
KSK/KSK0005380

KSK/KSK0005420
Hm? Gods....?
RUR/RUR0000770
Oh, and also....this shrine.[nl]It's a little-known power spot for love, I've heard.
RUR/RUR0000780
Even if it's just a wish or whatever,[nl]isn't it better then just doing nothing?

KSK/KSK0005430
That's right.[nl]Yeah......
