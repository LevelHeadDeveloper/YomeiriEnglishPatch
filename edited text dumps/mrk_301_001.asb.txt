Hey, Rakuuu. I am booored.[nl]Play with meeee.
RAK/RAK0080510
Sorry, play by yourself.
OTM/OTM0008130
But 'tis thy day off![nl]Thou canst play with me, so play with meee!
RAK/RAK0080520
Aaargh![nl]I already lent you some manga earlier, just read that![nl]I'm sorry, I've already made plans today.
RAK/RAK0080530
Oh, sounds like she's here.[nl]I'm gonna step out for a bit, so just stay here[nl]and keep quiet. Okay?
OTM/OTM0008140
Mgghh.

MRK/MRK0017490
Good morning, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0080540
Hey, Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0017500
....Right then, let us be off together!
RAK/RAK0080550
Hahaha, skipping the pleasantries, I see.
MRK/MRK0017510
Those aren't important.[nl]It's our day off, after all, so let's spend the day[nl]having fun together!
RAK/RAK0080560
Good grief....[nl]You sound just like Otama....[nl]
@expose
MRK/MRK0017520
Hm? What are you talking about?
RAK/RAK0080570
Nothing important.
MRK/MRK0017530
....Hahh. I see.
MRK/MRK0017540
Well, that doesn't matter.[nl]Anyway, let's hurry up and get going.[nl]I have a car waiting for us out front.
RAK/RAK0080580
A car....[nl]Where are you taking me, exactly?[nl]I thought I told you I wasn't going on any dates with you....
MRK/MRK0017550
Don't worry, what I have planned today isn't a date. ♪[nl]Come on, let's go!
RAK/RAK0080590
Waaagh!? Don't just pull my arm outta nowhere!
@ＢＧＭ停止
@フェードアウト
MRK/MRK0017560
Please, come in.
RAK/RAK0080600
You came and dragged me away against my will,[nl]and you take me to your room of all places....[nl]Isn't your dad home?
MRK/MRK0017570
My father is away on business.[nl]So please, make yourself at home.
RAK/RAK0080610
It's kinda hard for me to do that in a girl's room....
MRK/MRK0017580
Well then, *ahem*....
MRK/MRK0017590
Welcome home, darling. ★
RAK/RAK0080620
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0017600
You don't want to go on a date,[nl]but you're okay if we just have fun, right?
MRK/MRK0017610
So then, let's have fun playing make-believe.
RAK/RAK0080630
M-Make-believe!?
RAK/RAK0080640
For God's sake, I'm not a child,[nl]I can't do something that embarrassing!
MRK/MRK0017620
Awww.... But we used to do this all the time.[nl]Why don't we revisit our childhood for a while?
RAK/RAK0080650
Maybe we could do this when we were kids,[nl]but now we're a bit too old for make-believe.
MRK/MRK0017630
But if we don't, you won't be able to go home,[nl]will you, Raku dearest?
MRK/MRK0017640
My father's bound to come back while you're still here,[nl]and if I cry, he may have to press you for answers....
RAK/RAK0080660
Nghh....[nl]An underhanded trick!
RAK/RAK0080670
Fine, I'll do it! But only until your father gets back[nl]from the office! If I do this, will you let me go?
MRK/MRK0017650
Of course! That sounds good enough.
RAK/RAK0080680
(Dammit....[nl] At this point, she's basically threatening me.)
RAK/RAK0080690
(It can't be helped....[nl] Let's just go along with this and[nl] get the hell outta here.)
MRK/MRK0017660
Alright, let's continue.[nl]Welcome home, darling. ★
RAK/RAK0080700
Ummm.... I-I'm home.
MRK/MRK0017670
Thank you so much for all your hard work today.[nl]I have dinner and a bath ready for you.
RAK/RAK0080710
O-Okay....[nl]Thanks, as usual.
MRK/MRK0017680
We are a married couple, after all. ♪
RAK/RAK0080720
(Gaaaaaah! I'm still too embarrassed![nl] It would have been so much better if I'd[nl] just agreed to the date!)
MRK/MRK0017690
Let's see, when we were kids,[nl]what was it you said after that line?
RAK/RAK0080730
Heck if I know....[nl]I'm sorry, I don't remember at all.
MRK/MRK0017700
Didn't you imitate your father at that point?
MRK/MRK0017710
I remember you'd shout[nl]"We're gonna raid 'em! Get me my pistol!"
RAK/RAK0080740
Gah!?[nl]Out of everyone I could imitate, I had to go with him.
MRK/MRK0017720
After that, your father would scold us both. He'd go[nl]"people who do such foolish things need to be arrested!".[nl]Hehe. ♪
MRK/MRK0017730
Anyway, I'm going to get some snacks and drinks in lieu[nl]of dinner. Please wait here for a moment.
RAK/RAK0080750
O-Okay. Thanks!
RAK/RAK0080760
....Well, as long as we're just eating snacks[nl]and talking, it won't be any different from usual.
@時間経過演出
....
RAK/RAK0080770
(Having another look at the room,[nl] it's clear Tachibana's good at keeping it tidy....)
RAK/RAK0080780
(Hm? What's that?)
RAK/RAK0080790
(....It's a very messy drawing.)
MRK/MRK0017740
Raku dear....I mean, darling. ★[nl]I brought us some drinks.
MRK/MRK0017750
Go ahead, take one.
RAK/RAK0080800
Oh, thank you.[nl]I see you've still got that thing up.
MRK/MRK0017760
What were you looking at?
RAK/RAK0080810
Well, I was looking at that picture....
MRK/MRK0017770
That picture....? Oh.
MRK/MRK0017780
Raku dearest....don't you remember?
RAK/RAK0080820
Huh? Did I see that ten years ago?
RAK/RAK0080830
Hmmm....I don't remember at all.[nl]Did a great artist make that?
MRK/MRK0017790
Hmmm, I see.....[nl]At least for me, that picture just might be the greatest[nl]in the world.
RAK/RAK0080840
Ooh, interesting....
RAK/RAK0080850
(I guess Tachibana's into that kind of art.[nl] It kinda looks like a bad doodle to me....[nl] You never know, I guess.)
MRK/MRK0017800
Come on, picture aside for a while,[nl]how about we play some more?
MRK/MRK0017810
I just got a call from my father,[nl]and he says he'll be working late today, so we can do[nl]all kinds of things together, is that alright?
RAK/RAK0080860
Like hell it's alright![nl]I mean, when can I go home!?
MRK/MRK0017820
Hehehe. Make yourself at home here, darling. ★
OTM/OTM0008150
....How much longer doth Raku intendeth to spend[nl]entertaining his guest? I'm hungry....
