SYU/SYU0012230
Rakuuu! How about a game of cards?
RAK/RAK0062910
Cards....?[nl]Don't tell me you mean Old Maid.
SYU/SYU0012240
Yeah, you guessed it.[nl]Well, no surprise there, since it's so popular, I guess.
RAK/RAK0062920
Yeah, well....[nl]I got into a real mess with Old Maid the other day.[nl]I'd rather avoid playing it if possible....
SYU/SYU0012250
Hmmmm....
SYU/SYU0012260
Onodera, Ruri![nl]Raku says he's not gonna play!
RAK/RAK0062930
Whaaat!?
KSK/KSK0016850
I see, that's a shame....[nl]Okay, should we go find someone else?
RAK/RAK0062940
What are you talking about, Shuu?[nl]Get out your cards.
@expose
KSK/KSK0016860
Huh? Y-You do want to play?
RAK/RAK0062950
Of course I do, Onodera![nl]I'm always ready for a game!
SYU/SYU0012270
Pffft....[nl]It's too easy with you, man!
RUR/RUR0012170
If we're gonna play, we'd better hurry.[nl]Break period is almost over.
SYU/SYU0012280
I know! Let's make it so that the 1st place winner gets to[nl]tell everyone to do whatever he or she wants!
KSK/KSK0016870
H-Huhh!? You can't just spring this on us!
SYU/SYU0012290
It's already been decided! Come on, let's get started!
RUR/RUR0012180
I....I can't let Maiko win this game.
RAK/RAK0062960
Right. If we let him win, he'll almost certainly use[nl]his wish for something sexual-harassment-adjacent.
RAK/RAK0062970
(I'll do whatever it takes to stop Shuu from winning[nl]and protect Onodera!)
