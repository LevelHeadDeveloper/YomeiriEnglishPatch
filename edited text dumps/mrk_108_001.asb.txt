65 points.... That's so-so.
SYU/SYU0014010
Hoho, that's quite the impressive average score you got[nl]on the singing test.
SYU/SYU0014020
Honestly, Raku, if you weren't always surrounded by Kirisaki[nl]and all the other hotties in class,[nl]I'd think you were just an average guy.
@expose
SYU/SYU0014030
Yep! Most average of the average![nl]And the most average boy in Bonyari high!
RAK/RAK0076070
Average, average, shut up.[nl]What did you get?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0014040
That's ・ a ・ secret. ♪
RAK/RAK0076080
That's so annoying....
MRK/MRK0013000
It's okay, Raku dearest![nl]Even if you did get an average score, your strong, steady[nl]singing voice is truly one-of-a-kind.
SSR/SSR0021160
Really? Sounds to me like the sort of[nl]unremarkable voice you could hear anywhere.
RAK/RAK0076090
Would you all stop saying "average"?[nl]You're bumming me out.
CTG/CTG0022840
Oh, but here's something most people don't know.[nl]He's really good at enka.[nl]#fs{12}TN: Enka is a kind of Japanese folk music.#fs{}
RUR/RUR0012670
Ohh.... That's surprising.
KSK/KSK0018020
Ichijo, you like enka?[nl]I hadn't heard that.
RAK/RAK0076100
Y-Yeah....![nl]I sing a lot of enka.
RAK/RAK0076110
Maybe it's because of how I grew up,[nl]but I've been listening to enka since I was a kid,[nl]so naturally I can sing it pretty well.
SSR/SSR0021170
....Seems like kind of an "old man" skill.
RAK/RAK0076120
Don't call me an old man![nl]Or rather, apologize to every young fan of enka in Japan!
MRK/MRK0013010
Mmgh. More importantly, why is Kirisaki[nl]the only one who's heard Raku dearest's enka?
MRK/MRK0013020
It's not fair![nl]I want to hear Raku dearest sing enka, too!
RAK/RAK0076130
N-No.... I'm not *that* good.[nl]Please don't try to flatter me.
MRK/MRK0013030
Sensei! Play us some enka, please!
RAK/RAK0076140
H-Hey! Why are you asking the teacher to do that!?[nl]I can't sing here!
MRK/MRK0013040
Then we can go sing karaoke sometime.[nl]Wouldn't that be fine?
RAK/RAK0076150
Y-Yeah. I don't really mind....
CTG/CTG0022850
Karaoke, huh.... It's been a while since[nl]I've gone for good karaoke. Tsugumi, you should come too. ♪
SSR/SSR0021180
Huh!? I should!?
SYU/SYU0014050
Good, good![nl]Surely Ruri and the rest of us are coming too, right?
RUR/RUR0012680
That's fine. As long as you pay for everything[nl]and we sing in separate rooms.
SYU/SYU0014060
But then what's the point of going together!?
KSK/KSK0018030
Hahaha.... Sounds like fun.
RAK/RAK0076160
(O-Onodera's coming too.... That's great.[nl] If I can sing an awesome enka song with passion,[nl] maybe she'll like me more....)
MRK/MRK0013050
Well, we all can certainly go for karaoke[nl]together someday later....
MRK/MRK0013060
But we should go together, just us two, today![nl]Right, Raku dearest? ♪
@ザクシャ万里花・小
RAK/RAK0076170
Whaaa!? How come!?
MRK/MRK0013070
Because I want to hear as much of your sweet singing[nl]voice as I can.
MRK/MRK0013080
And when we're done, we can go out for dinner and[nl]then to a movie. That settles that!
CTG/CTG0022860
Hey, hey! That sounds too much like a date![nl]No way, he's not going!
MRK/MRK0013090
Hehe, you're flustered, Kirisaki. I understand.[nl]But ultimately it's up to Raku dearest whether or not he goes.
CTG/CTG0022870
Well, Darling!?
MRK/MRK0013100
You'll go, right, Raku dearest? ★
RAK/RAK0076180
(Aaagh....[nl] Now I'm caught in the middle....)
