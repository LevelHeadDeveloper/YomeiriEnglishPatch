My sister called me yesterday. She said she and her[nl]dorm-mates planned to tell each other stories one-by-one[nl]and she wanted to know if I had any she could use.
RAK/RAK0049290
Wow. So they do that kind of thing in dorms?[nl]Isn't that kind of a high hurdle?
KSK/KSK0014460
It seems to be a private kind of event.[nl]We talked about it for an hour, but neither of us[nl]could come up with any stories.
RUR/RUR0011290
She sounds like she's having fun with dorm life.[nl]I'm glad to hear it.
RAK/RAK0049300
Miyamoto, have you ever met Onodera's sister?
RUR/RUR0011300
Yeah, several times.[nl]She looks a lot like Kosaki.
SYU/SYU0008420
Then she must be cute, too![nl]I'd love to meet her just once!
RUR/RUR0011310
I don't think we should let Maiko[nl]anywhere near such an innocent young girl.

SYU/SYU0008430
Awww, what do you mean by that?[nl]That's terrible, Ruri!
RAK/RAK0049310
Onodera's sister looks just like her, huh.[nl]That's kinda hard to imagine, just from hearing it.
KSK/KSK0014470
Even though people keep saying we look alike, honestly,[nl]I think her personality's more robust than mine.
KSK/KSK0014480
She tries to make up for that with[nl]her Japanese confectionery work....
RAK/RAK0049320
Ohh, I see.
KSK/KSK0014490
Yeah. She also tends to make a lot of strong assumptions,[nl]but that's pretty cute, too.
You seem like the big-sister type.
You gotta introduce me to her!
RAK/RAK0049330
....Onodera, you really seem like the big sister type.
KSK/KSK0014500
Huh?
RAK/RAK0049340
I mean, you look incredibly happy whenever you're talking[nl]about your sister. You even seem to think she's cute.[nl]That kind of thing is nice.

KSK/KSK0014510
Hehehe. I hope she meets you someday, Ichijo.[nl]If that happens, be a good friend to her, okay?
RAK/RAK0049350
Yeah! Of course!
RAK/RAK0049360
I mean, you gotta--
SYU/SYU0008440
Introduce me!!
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0008450
Glbctkh!!
RUR/RUR0011320
I knew you were gonna say that.
SYU/SYU0008460
Mmmmmgh, a phenomenal right-straight punch,[nl]as usual.... Mghbth.

RUR/RUR0011330
Ichijo, *you're* not getting any ideas, right?
RAK/RAK0049370
N-Nooo! Absolutely not!
RUR/RUR0011340
I see. Very well, then.
KSK/KSK0014520
I'll introduce you when she gets back, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0049380
O-Okay. Thank you, very respectfully.....hahaha.
