Raku dearessst! ★[nl]Please help me with this thing I don't understand from class!
RAK/RAK0076420
Why do you have to hug me for me to teach you....
@expose
MRK/MRK0013320
Because this pose helps me concentrate. ♪
RAK/RAK0076430
Like hell it does!
SYU/SYU0014070
Hahaha! There she goes again.
RUR/RUR0012690
You do this every day, too.
RUR/RUR0012700
Kosaki, why not follow her lead and hug him for once?
KSK/KSK0018040
W-What are you saying!?
RAK/RAK0076440
Huh? ....What's wrong, Onodera?
KSK/KSK0018050
W-Well, Tachibana, you're always talking about Ichijo....[nl]Was it the same way at your old school?
MRK/MRK0013330
My old school?
RUR/RUR0012710
....You're changing the subject.
SYU/SYU0014080
Yeah, you're changing the subject.
KSK/KSK0018070
Jeez! Both of you be quiet!
SYU/SYU0014090
Yeah, but now I'm curious too.[nl]Marika, you're super cute, were you popular at your old school?
MRK/MRK0013340
Indeed I was....[nl]My old school was an all-girls' school, but boys from the surrounding[nl]schools would approach me frequently.
MRK/MRK0013350
It was most repulsive.
RAK/RAK0076450
Don't smile when you say that.
MRK/MRK0013360
But then, one fateful day, all of a sudden,[nl]not one came near me anymore.
RUR/RUR0012720
One fateful day....?
KSK/KSK0018080
I-Is this a scary story?
MRK/MRK0013370
No, it's actually pretty normal.
MRK/MRK0013380
My father accompanied me to school one day, and the rest is history.
SYU/SYU0014100
Huh....? Was that it?
MRK/MRK0013390
Yes, that was it.
RAK/RAK0076460
....You've got some father.
@フェードアウト
RAK/RAK0076470
(He's got some glare, and some build....)
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0076480
I guess I can understand that....[nl]Like maybe they were afraid they'd be sent to jail[nl]if they got near you.
MRK/MRK0013400
Of course we wouldn't go that far.[nl]They would be thorougly investigated, though.
RAK/RAK0076490
They did that!?
MRK/MRK0013410
But you have nothing to worry about, Raku dearest.[nl]After all, our relationship has already been approved by my father. ♪
RAK/RAK0076500
But *I* don't recall approving it.
MRK/MRK0013420
It's only a matter of time.
KSK/KSK0018090
A-Ahahaha....[nl]You haven't changed a bit, Tachibana.
