Hahahaha, and then....
MRK/MRK0012580
Oooh, was that what happened?Hehehe....
SYU/SYU0013940
Marika seems to be fitting right in with our class.
RAK/RAK0075490
I guess she is.[nl]She's even having a friendly conversation with the[nl]other girls right now.
RAK/RAK0075500
As for me, I'm glad she's getting along well[nl]with the other girls.
SYU/SYU0013950
Oho, what do you mean?
RAK/RAK0075510
It's easier on my mind because she doesn't hug me every time[nl]I walk in. And it's easier on my body, too, because[nl]Chitoge and Tsugumi don't chase me around afterwards.
SYU/SYU0013960
Hmmm. Sounds like you're having a hard time.
SYU/SYU0013970
But I'm incredibly curious what Marika and the other girls[nl]are talking about.
RAK/RAK0075520
(I'm definitely curious myself....)
@expose
SYU/SYU0013980
Alright, let's listen in from here.[nl]Raku, you'd better keep quiet!
RAK/RAK0075530
This is just wrong, dude....
SYU/SYU0013990
Shhhh. It's fine, it's fine.
MRK/MRK0012590
....So I just can't help but think about my darling Raku,[nl]with his sharp eyes, and his reasonably comfortable[nl]embrace, and his....♪
RAK/RAK0075540
Glbctkh!
RAK/RAK0075550
W-What the hell is she talking about!?
MRK/MRK0012600
Besides, he's surprisingly forward.[nl]Just the other day, we had a sweet time at home,[nl]and he held me on his shoulders at the festival....
WSA/WSA0000230
Oooh....[nl]Ichijo's surprisingly scummy.
WSB/WSB0000230
If Kirisaki was here, we'd have had a real battlefield.[nl]Too bad.
RAK/RAK0075560
Gwaahhhh.... She's saying whatever she wants[nl]about stuff that never happened!
Stop Marika
Keep quiet
RAK/RAK0075570
Hey, Marika! Come here for a sec![nl]Stop saying all those weird things!
MRK/MRK0012610
Oh, my! I can't believe Raku dearest is calling for me!
MRK/MRK0012620
I shall jump to Raku dearest posthaste!
RAK/RAK0075580
Gaaaah! Don't actually jump on me!
@叫び揺れ
MRK/MRK0012630
Ahh, I do so love your embrace.[nl]It's cozier than any pillow for a good night's rest....
@ザクシャ万里花・中
RAK/RAK0075590
Cut it out! Everyone'll stare!
MRK/MRK0012640
S-So it'll be OK if no one's around to see us!?
RAK/RAK0075600
Will you calm down!?
MRK/MRK0012650
But I'm so glad you called for me, Raku dearest....[nl]I simply cannot control my racing heart!
MRK/MRK0012660
Oh, would you like to feel my heartbeat?[nl]Here, just put your hand here....
RAK/RAK0075610
Hey!? Let go of my hand!
WSA/WSA0000240
Ohh.... He's getting flirty with Marika again.
WSB/WSB0000240
Where's Kirisaki? Could we still have a battlefield!?
RAK/RAK0075620
(W-What!?[nl] I thought I was stepping in to make this better!?)
SYU/SYU0014000
Nyahahaha. So it's come to this after all.
MRK/MRK0012670
Come on, Raku dearest. Touch me some more!
RAK/RAK0075630
....Jeez, just shut up for God's sake.
RAK/RAK0075640
(Times like this, I think it's best[nl] to just stay quiet and let it go, maybe....)
RAK/RAK0075650
(Luckily, it doesn't look like Chitoge or anyone else is around,[nl] so I can just sneak away with no one the wiser....)
CTG/CTG0022770
Hey, darling....[nl]I can hear Marika talking from all the way down the hallway,[nl]what's all that about?
RAK/RAK0075660
Gah!? Y-You heard that!?
CTG/CTG0022780
Why are you so quiet, darling,[nl]when Marika's over here saying whatever she wants?
CTG/CTG0022790
Or maybe hearing those things makes you happy....
RAK/RAK0075670
N-Not at all![nl]This is kind of a complicated operation....
CTG/CTG0022800
Whatever, just go stop her![nl]You stupid bean sprout!!
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0075680
Glbtckh!
RAK/RAK0075690
Nghh.... Even though it's not my fault....[nl]That's just absurd....
