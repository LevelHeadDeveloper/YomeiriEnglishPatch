Hello hello, Raku~![nl]Where are you right now? Care to stop for[nl]some karaoke on the way home?
RAK/RAK0082590
Sorry, Shuu. I'm in a bit of trouble at the moment.[nl]It'll take a while.
RAK/RAK0082600
For some reason, an agent from Chitoge's[nl]family is chasing me. I have to leave school[nl]without being seen somehow...
SYU/SYU0014180
Hoho...![nl]So it's a stealth mission!
SYU/SYU0014190
....I'm sure you have a box, right?
RAK/RAK0082610
What? A box?[nl]No, not with me, why?
SYU/SYU0014200
What are you talking about?[nl]Everyone knows that the key to any stealth mission[nl]is to hide in a cardboard box.
RAK/RAK0082620
Oh, for real?[nl]I'd never heard about that!
SYU/SYU0014210
Really!?[nl]Are there any boxes near you?[nl]Even some cube-type health foods, or a cigarette box?
RAK/RAK0082630
Why would there be![nl]Putting aside the absurdity of cube-type health foods,[nl]I'm a minor! I can't have tobacco!
SYU/SYU0014220
Oh boy. You're lacking equipment, then.
SYU/SYU0014230
...But fret not, Raku![nl]Even if you don't have a box of your own, there's[nl]a bunch of them in the school already!
SYU/SYU0014250
Just stand next to one and press â—‹ to hide[nl]inside it! Go ahead!
RAK/RAK0082640
H-how did you have this all ready!?
RAK/RAK0082650
Whatever...[nl]At the very least, it's helpful.[nl]Thanks, Shuu.
SYU/SYU0014280
Aah. Good luck!
