....Hm?[nl]What's that you're drawing in your textbook, Miyamoto?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RUR/RUR0009760
Oh, Ichijo. This is nothing.
RAK/RAK0043540
You say it's nothing, but that's a very appealing picture....[nl]Is it even okay to draw that in a textbook?
RUR/RUR0009770
It's not a problem. This isn't mine.
RAK/RAK0043550
Huh!? That's not your textbook!?[nl]That's even worse!
RUR/RUR0009780
It's just a cute little prank.[nl]It comes off with an eraser, and it's easy to laugh off.
RUR/RUR0009790
More importantly, Ichijo,[nl]are you the sort of person who draws in textbooks?
RAK/RAK0043560
Hmmm, let's see....[nl]I--
I draw in textbooks.
I don't draw in textbooks.
RAK/RAK0043570
Sometimes, I can't help but draw beards[nl]on the author's photo....

RUR/RUR0009800
That's a classic.
RAK/RAK0043580
I wonder what the author would say[nl]if they saw it?
RUR/RUR0009810
Who knows? I don't think they'd mind, honestly.[nl]Frankly, I'd be more annoyed that someone published[nl]my diary in a textbook.
RAK/RAK0043590
When you put it like that, classical literature[nl]is terrifying....
RUR/RUR0009820
And having your love letters read out loud.[nl]It's not a good idea to become too famous.
RAK/RAK0043600
Agreed.
RAK/RAK0043610
No, not at all.[nl]My textbooks are all pristine.
RUR/RUR0009830
Oh, I see. You're boring, then.
RAK/RAK0043620
You really have to say that just because[nl]I'm responsible with my textbooks?
RUR/RUR0009840
Can you go away, so I can concentrate[nl]on finishing this drawing?
RAK/RAK0043630
Okay, okay. See you around, Miyamoto.
