Raku, let's walk home together.
RAK/RAK0061400
Alright, sure.[nl]Lemme just grab my stuff and I'll be ready in a sec.
SYU/SYU0011230
Huh? Kirisaki's not with you today?[nl]And neither are Seishiro and the others....
RAK/RAK0061410
They all left when they heard the other girls[nl]were making a stop somewhere on the way home.
@expose
SYU/SYU0011240
I see. So it's just the two of us, huh.[nl]....That's so boring.
RAK/RAK0061420
Stop acting so blatantly suddenly disinterested.
SYU/SYU0011250
Haha, just kidding.[nl]Let's get going whenever you're ready.

KYK/KYK0000470
Hm? Ichijo, Maiko, you're walking home together today?
SYU/SYU0011260
Wassup, Ms. Kyoko? ♪[nl]How about coming with us? That way, with me and Raku,[nl]you could have flowers in both hands.
KYK/KYK0000480
Hahaha! Calling yourselves flowers,[nl]you two sure have a lot of self-confidence!
RAK/RAK0061430
Um, I didn't say anything....
KYK/KYK0000490
I'm sorry I have to refuse,[nl]but I've got a meeting to attend today.
KYK/KYK0000500
It's fine by me if you two let loose after school gets out,[nl]but don't go causing me any trouble.
SYU/SYU0011270
Okaaay!
RAK/RAK0061440
(What kinda teacher is she....?)
@フェードアウト
....
SYU/SYU0011280
Oooh! There's Marika's attendant, Honda!
RAK/RAK0061450
What's she doing here, away from Tachibana?
SYU/SYU0011290
I dunno, but she's a hottie and she's right there![nl]Let's go talk to her!
SYU/SYU0011300
Heeeey, Honda!
RAK/RAK0061460
Oh, hey...!
RAK/RAK0061470
(He's always so quick on the draw....)
HND/HND0000640
Hello, Master Ichijo. And....[nl]You're Master Maiko, correct?
SYU/SYU0011310
Yep! Feel free to affectionately call me "Shuu-kun".
RAK/RAK0061480
Uhh, you don't actually have to call him that.
RAK/RAK0061490
More importantly, what are you doing here?
HND/HND0000650
I left my men to guard the Mistress today,[nl]and I'm out on patrol.
SYU/SYU0011320
Wow, you're so dedicated to your work, that's so cool![nl]I kind of admire you.
HND/HND0000660
Thank you.
HND/HND0000670
Well, I'm off to patrol another district.[nl]Please excuse me.
HND/HND0000680
Please continue to take good care of the mistress,[nl]Master Ichijo and Master Maiko.
SYU/SYU0011330
Yes, yes, leave it to us!
RAK/RAK0061500
She never called you "Shuu-kun".
SYU/SYU0011340
What a shame.
KSM/KSM0000190
Oh! Good evening, kid.[nl]Heading home?
RAK/RAK0061510
Oh, Onodera's mom![nl]I hope you're having a good evening too.
SYU/SYU0011350
Whaaat!? This is Onodera's mother!?
SYU/SYU0011360
She's such a lovely lady, but she's a mother....
KSM/KSM0000200
Oh, that's so sweet of you to say![nl]I can take that to mean I still look good?
SYU/SYU0011370
Absolutely great![nl]If you'd like, we can have some tea together....
RAK/RAK0061520
Hey! Don't go hitting on women all over the place!
KSM/KSM0000210
Hehe.... You've sure got interesting friends, Ichijo.[nl]You should really cherish your friendships with people[nl]like him, right?
SYU/SYU0011380
You sure know your stuff, Onodera's mom![nl]Right as per usual.
SYU/SYU0011390
You gotta cherish me, Raku.
RAK/RAK0061530
(You saying that makes me so angry....)
KSM/KSM0000220
I'd appreciate it if you'd also come support our shop.[nl]We're releasing a new line of sweets soon, so please[nl]stop in and try them.
KSM/KSM0000230
Ichijo, we could use your help again.
RAK/RAK0061540
Of course. I'll come back and help soon.
SYU/SYU0011400
And I'll go with him when he does!
KSM/KSM0000240
Alright, I'm looking forward to it.[nl]See you then.
SYU/SYU0011410
Take care!
@expose2
SYU/SYU0011420
....Maaan! Ms. Kyoko, Ms. Honda and Onodera's mom are[nl]all great! Working women are top-tier!
RAK/RAK0061550
You're getting too worked up....[nl]You were so low-energy when it was just the two of us.
SYU/SYU0011430
That was then, this is now.[nl]Mature women just have that special charm to them.[nl]Right, Ichijo Boy?
RAK/RAK0061560
That's disgusting. Cut it out.
SYU/SYU0011440
Don't be so uptight![nl]Let's go home as friends and remain friends!
SYU/SYU0011450
Mwehehehe.... My goal is to lead a rosy life,[nl]surrounded by women. What say you, good buddy!?
RAK/RAK0061570
(....I wonder if I should really be his friend.)
