It's almost winter already, huh....[nl]I can't believe it's already been more than half a year[nl]since we started at this school. Time sure flies.
RAK/RAK0049660
I guess so.[nl]Maybe it's because we have so much fun every day.
RUR/RUR0011400
....Hey, what are your dreams for the future, Kosaki?[nl]Have you chosen a career path yet?
KSK/KSK0014600
Huh? Future dreams?[nl]I don't really have any specific ideas yet....
RAK/RAK0049670
Are you gonna take over the sweetshop?
KSK/KSK0014610
Y-Yeah.[nl]I'm hoping I can do that, at least.
@expose
KSK/KSK0014620
I dream that my husband and I can run the sweetshop....[nl]That way, we can make a happy family.
RAK/RAK0049680
I see.
What a lovely dream!
What an average dream!

@ザクシャ小咲・中
KSK/KSK0014630
Yes, thank you.
RUR/RUR0011410
I see. So, when looking for a prospective husband,[nl]you'll be looking for a good cook.
KSK/KSK0014640
Yeah....wait, huh!?
RUR/RUR0011420
Well, sure. Did I say something wrong?
KSK/KSK0014650
Uhh.....n-no, not really....[nl]Yeah, if he was a good cook, that would be....nice.
RAK/RAK0049700
A guy who can cook well....huh.
RAK/RAK0049710
(I'm pretty confident in my cooking abilities....[nl] But it's Onodera's choice, after all....)
KSK/KSK0014660
------
RAK/RAK0049720
That's a fairly standard dream.
KSK/KSK0014670
Hahaha, I....guess that's true?
RAK/RAK0049730
But it does sound like your style, Onodera.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0014680
Thanks. But before any of that,[nl]I need to graduate high school properly.
RUR/RUR0011430
You're not very good at studying, are you, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0014690
I'm always grateful to you for your help, Ruri!
