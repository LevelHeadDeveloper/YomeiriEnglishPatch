Glasses are an excellent accessory[nl]in that they aren't in violation of the school dress code.
RUR/RUR0006490
Anyone can easily enjoy fashion[nl]by simply wearing glasses.
RUR/RUR0006500
Ichijo, are you trying to ruin the[nl]opportunity for everyone to be fashionable?
Are glasses fashionable?
It doesn't matter for the boys
If everyone wore them,[nl]they'd lose their individuality
Their faces would lose[nl]their cuteness
RUR/RUR0006510
No. There is no rule that says that[nl]boys can't be fashionable as well.
RUR/RUR0006520
Rather, they would do well[nl]to care at least a little.
RUR/RUR0006530
Ichijo, I think you could study up[nl]on popular male celebrities who wear glasses.

In the winter, when everyone's wearing coats,[nl]couldn't you be fashionable with any coat?
RUR/RUR0006550
When it's raining, and everyone has an umbrella,[nl]does any one umbrella lose individuality?
RUR/RUR0006560
Tell me, wouldn't that be true?
RUR/RUR0006570
If everyone's wearing glasses,[nl]they can still make a statement with the color and frames.
RUR/RUR0006580
Your criticism of mass adoption is nonsense.

If everyone wore glasses,[nl]we'd definitely lose the fashionable bare-faced style.
RUR/RUR0006600
I'm sure we'd soon lose the desire to regret that....
RUR/RUR0006610
But I suppose I can't deny it.
RUR/RUR0006620
Since you won't answer,[nl]I find myself wondering if you understand.
