(Tachibana had to go to the infirmary again today.[nl] I'm pretty worried, I'd better go check on her for a bit....)

MRK/MRK0012800
Oh.... Why, if it isn't Raku dearest.[nl]Is something the matter?
RAK/RAK0075880
No, not really.
MRK/MRK0012810
Could it be you're feeling unwell?
MRK/MRK0012820
That won't do at all![nl]Please take your jacket off so that we can[nl]get you a bed right away!
RAK/RAK0075890
No, no![nl]I'm just here to check up on you!
@expose
MRK/MRK0012830
On me?
MRK/MRK0012840
....I see. Hehehe, thank you very much.
MRK/MRK0012850
But it was only a little anemia.[nl]I'm fine, so you don't need to worry so much.
RAK/RAK0075900
But this anemia happens a lot, right?[nl]You sure you're okay?
MRK/MRK0012860
....It's a long, hard road for a woman on a diet.
RAK/RAK0075910
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0012870
It takes extraordinary efforts, such as[nl]skipping breakfast and running, to achieve the ideal proportions[nl]to please my darling Raku.
RAK/RAK0075920
I'm not so sure if that's healthy or not....
RAK/RAK0075930
But don't you need to eat breakfast?[nl]If you didn't, I wouldn't be terribly pleased.
RAK/RAK0075940
Besides, you're not that physically strong.[nl]You don't have to push yourself.
MRK/MRK0012880
....I'd hardly say I'm pushing myself.
MRK/MRK0012890
My greatest source of energy is being around you,[nl]Raku dearest. When we're apart, I get weaker.
RAK/RAK0075950
How does that even work....
MRK/MRK0012900
Besides, I'm doing everything I can[nl]to build up my strength.
MRK/MRK0012910
I want to be able to spend more time with you.[nl]I want to be the sort of energetic girl who would[nl]pair wellwith my darling Raku.
MRK/MRK0012920
And for that, I'm willing to overcome any obstacle.
RAK/RAK0075960
Tachibana....
RAK/RAK0075970
I got this from Onodera's parents' sweetshop.
MRK/MRK0012930
Oh, what a lovely Japanese sweet.
RAK/RAK0075980
Just eat this and feel better.[nl]It's very good.
MRK/MRK0012940
Hahaha. I see. I *do* want to get well enough[nl]to go on dates with you every day.
@ザクシャ万里花・小
RAK/RAK0075990
No, not every day....
RAK/RAK0076000
Anyway, don't even think about skipping dinner, okay?
RAK/RAK0076010
Don't even think about skipping dinner, okay?
RAK/RAK0076020
Um.... Even if you put on a little weight,[nl]I'm not gonna hate you for it.
MRK/MRK0012950
Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0076030
I know I just said something really embarrassing,[nl]just don't read too much into it.
MRK/MRK0012960
No, that's not it....[nl]It's generally considered tactless to[nl]bring up a woman's weight.
RAK/RAK0076040
Oh, for real!?[nl]But I'm sure....
MRK/MRK0012970
You've got no tact, Raku dearest....[nl]But I'll happily accept that.
MRK/MRK0012980
Well then, let's get married, shall we?
RAK/RAK0076050
Good to see you're doing better.[nl]See you later.
MRK/MRK0012990
Aaaah! Raku dearest, stop teasing me!
