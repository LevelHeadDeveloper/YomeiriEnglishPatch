Let's see, add the butter, sugar, and eggs to a bowl....[nl]Then stir well, and....
CTG/CTG0003560
Then you add the flour mixture and mix it by hand, right?
SSR/SSR0000010
Correct, Mistress. That will be the cookie dough.[nl]Roll it out thinly, cut it into whatever shape you want,[nl]and you're done.
CTG/CTG0003570
Okay. Thanks, Tsugumi.
CTG/CTG0003580
Cookies are surprisingly easy to make.[nl]I think I can handle this.
SSR/SSR0000020
Well, after all, it is just a high school cooking class.[nl]It's not intended to require a lot of skill.
CTG/CTG0003590
Yeah. I'll be just fine.
CTG/CTG0003600
Alright, how should I shape this?
@expose
CTG/CTG0003610
-----
CTG/CTG0003620
Hmmm.....
CTG/CTG0003630
Hmmmmm.....
MRK/MRK0000010
Oh?
MRK/MRK0000020
Kirisaki, what kind of shape is that?
CTG/CTG0003640
Huh? Just a normal dog shape, why?
MRK/MRK0000030
T-That Picasso-painting-esque shape is a dog....
MRK/MRK0000050
Hehe....as usual, Kirisaki, your modelling skills[nl]are strictly professional-quality.
CTG/CTG0003650
What, are you saying I'm bad at this?[nl]It doesn't matter if it looks a little weird.[nl]Once you eat it, it's all the same.
SSR/SSR0000030
That's another problem all on its own, Mistress.
RUR/RUR0000260
On that note, I'm absolutely smitten with[nl]how good Kosaki's modelling is.
RUR/RUR0000270
How any artist could sculpt a three-dimensional rose[nl]out of cookie dough is beyond me.
KSK/KSK0000360
Hehehehe......
RUR/RUR0000280
Now if only it tasted good....
........
RAK/RAK0002060
(Alright, now I just need to bake mine.)
RAK/RAK0002070
(When they're done, we're supposed to share them out[nl] to the rest of the group and grade each other's work....)
RAK/RAK0002080
Hahh.....
SYU/SYU0000010
Hey, hey, Raku.
RAK/RAK0002090
What?
SYU/SYU0000020
Whose cookies are you looking forward to?[nl]I'll bet you want Onodera's to win?
RAK/RAK0002100
No, I'd rather not have Onodera's, if possible....
RAK/RAK0002120
Or Chitoge's, either, for the same reason.
SYU/SYU0000030
What, so you're scared?
SYU/SYU0000040
I was certain you'd say something like[nl]"I don't care how bad it tastes, as long as I have love!"
RAK/RAK0002140
Heh, you fool....
RAK/RAK0002110
You've never eaten anything Onodera's made.[nl]That's how you can say something so dumb.
SYU/SYU0000050
Well, you did say earlier that you ate some porridge[nl]she made you and you went through hell. Is it that bad?
RAK/RAK0002130
Yeah. You'd better avoid both of their cookies, too.[nl]Unless you *want* a near-death experience.
SYU/SYU0000060
Haha. I'm kind of tempted to eat them now.
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0003660
All ready!
SYU/SYU0000070
Oho! I've been waiting for this!
SSR/SSR0000040
Now, all that's left is to decide who tastes whose cookie.
MRK/MRK0000060
Well, if that's the case, then of course[nl]Raku dearest gets my cookies--
CTG/CTG0003670
Oh, hang on, Marika![nl]What the hell are you talking about!?
MRK/MRK0000070
There's nothing wrong with the early bird getting the worm.[nl]Besides, I'm sure Raku dearest would much rather[nl]eat my cookies than your weirdly shaped ones!
CTG/CTG0003680
What did you say!?
CTG/CTG0003690
That's not true at all! Right, darling!?
RAK/RAK0002150
Huh? Umm...well...
RAK/RAK0002160
(It's too hard to answer!)
SYU/SYU0000080
Hey, hey. Everyone hold your horses.
SYU/SYU0000090
Why don't we draw straws using these disposable[nl]chopsticks? If we draw someone else's number,[nl]we taste their cookies.
RAK/RAK0002170
...Yeah. That sound like it'll be fair!
MRK/MRK0000080
Hmmmm....it's a shame, but if my darling Raku wishes it,[nl]then it can't be helped.
SSR/SSR0000050
Then let's draw lots one at a time.[nl]Raku Ichijo, you first.
RAK/RAK0002180
S-Sure! Me first, huh....
RAK/RAK0002190
Out of the seven batches of cookies, one is outstandingly[nl]beautifully shaped, and another is outstandingly....[nl]avant-garde-ly shaped. 
KSK/KSK0000370
Oh, those are mine and Chitoge's.
RAK/RAK0002200
Yeah, I figured....
RAK/RAK0002210
God, Buddha, whoever's listening....[nl]Please, anyone other than those two....
OTM/OTM0000010
'Tis my time to shine....!
RAK/RAK0002220
Huh?
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0002230
Otama!? What are you doing here!?
OTM/OTM0000020
I hath seen that thou art in trouble,[nl]so I came here to aid thee.
RAK/RAK0002240
No, you're just here because you smelled cookies,[nl]not because I'm in trouble!
OTM/OTM0000030
Mhm. Thou art more than half right!
RAK/RAK0002250
Dammit, I told you to stay at home and keep quiet!
CTG/CTG0003700
Hey, Raku? Is there something under the sink?[nl]Do you think it's some kind of weird bug?
RAK/RAK0002260
Uhh....no, it's fine! I got rid of it already.
OTM/OTM0000040
Mgh....it is very rude to treat me like a weird bug.
RAK/RAK0002270
It's fine! Stay here and hide.[nl]It would be a huge nuisance if you were found!
OTM/OTM0000050
Very well. There is no shortage of powers that[nl]I can use from underneath the sink, anyway.
RAK/RAK0002280
Powers? You're not gonna do something weird, are you?
OTM/OTM0000060
Hehehe. Worry not. I shall not do anything bad.
SYU/SYU0000100
Hey, hey, Raku. Don't be shy, just draw your straw.[nl]You're holding up the line.
RAK/RAK0002290
R-Right!
RAK/RAK0002300
(I'm a bit concerned about what Otama just said,[nl] but I'll draw my lot anyway....)
RAK/RAK0002310
Okay....
RAK/RAK0002320
Number 1.
CTG/CTG0003710
I got 3.
KSK/KSK0000380
Number 4.... Who's that?
MRK/MRK0000090
Mine's lucky 7!
SSR/SSR0000060
Number 6.
RUR/RUR0000300
2.
SYU/SYU0000110
So that means I get the last one left, 5.
MRK/MRK0000100
Well then, Maiko, who got who?
SYU/SYU0000120
Alright, I shall read out everyone's names[nl]and corresponding numbers! Let's see....
SYU/SYU0000130
Hmm, what....!?
RAK/RAK0002330
What is it?
SYU/SYU0000140
Hey, that's surprising![nl]I didn't even know this kind of coincidence was possible!
SYU/SYU0000150
It would seem everybody drew the same number[nl]as their name.
CTG/CTG0003720
Huh!? No way! You mean everyone got their own cookies!?
KSK/KSK0000390
What a coincidence....!
RUR/RUR0000310
Indeed. With seven people and seven straws,[nl]the number of combinations is 7 to the power of 7--
CTG/CTG0003730
That's....a 1 in 5040 chance!?
SYU/SYU0000160
Amazing. It's not impossible, but it is rare.
MRK/MRK0000110
So what if it's rare?[nl]We can't judge our own cookies.
RAK/RAK0002340
....Hey, did you do this?
OTM/OTM0000070
Of course.[nl]Thou art trying to avoid those two's cookies, right?
OTM/OTM0000080
Hehehe....be grateful, alright?
RAK/RAK0002350
Well, I guess I don't need to worry about food poisoning[nl]from my own cookies....
CTG/CTG0003740
Hey, Raku. Who the hell are you talking to?
RAK/RAK0002360
Uh, n-no one....!
MRK/MRK0000120
Can't we just not have the lottery, please?[nl]Let everyone eat whoever's cookies they want.
SSR/SSR0000070
Mhm. Well, I don't have any objections....
MRK/MRK0000130
Well then, Raku dearest,[nl]please have some of the fruits of my love!
@画面揺らし2
RAK/RAK0002370
----Gmmpthck!
CTG/CTG0003750
Hey! Hold on, there, Marika![nl]Just what do you think you're doing!?
MRK/MRK0000140
Hehehe, you should have been faster!
CTG/CTG0003760
Jeez, you're a pain....
MRK/MRK0000150
Well, Raku dearest? How does it taste?
RAK/RAK0002380
Nom.....mmmh.....
RAK/RAK0002390
Oh, yes. This isn't half bad....[nl]It's got just the right amount of sweetness,[nl]feels nice on the tongue, and it's perfectly crispy as well....
RAK/RAK0002400
That's how you can tell the butter and sugar[nl]were mixed properly. I think it's pretty good.
MRK/MRK0000160
Well! Since you say that, these were worth making![nl]Thank you so much!
SYU/SYU0000170
Hey, are Marika's cookies really that good?[nl]May I have one?
MRK/MRK0000170
Well....as long as it's just one.[nl]Here you go.
SYU/SYU0000180
Chomp!
SYU/SYU0000190
Oho! It's true! This is delicious....![nl]It looks good, too, and it could even pass[nl]as a commercial-grade product!
RAK/RAK0002410
Tachibana's a pretty good cook.
MRK/MRK0000180
That's right, I have been training myself every day[nl]without fail to be the perfect bride for my darling Raku![nl]Cooking well is hardly an issue for me!
MRK/MRK0000190
....Which is more than a certain gorilla can say.
CTG/CTG0003770
H-Hey, what are you talking about!?[nl]You're talking like I can't cook at all....!
CTG/CTG0003780
That's not true, right, everyone!?[nl]I can cook a little, too!?
@ＢＧＭ停止
CTG/CTG0003790
Huh? W-Why's everyone so quiet?
SYU/SYU0000200
Well, the thing is, um....
KSK/KSK0000400
Ummm....[nl]I can't exactly speak for the others, but....
SSR/SSR0000080
Mistress....ummm....[nl]I say this with all due respect, but I think in this case....[nl]Marika Tachibana may have a point....
CTG/CTG0003800
E-Et tu, Tsugumi!?
CTG/CTG0003810
You all seriously think of me as the girl who can't cook!?
RAK/RAK0002420
Are we wrong?
CTG/CTG0003820
Of course you're wrong! I've been secretly training![nl]And I've definitely improved since the first semester!
CTG/CTG0003830
If you think I'm lying, eat this![nl]I'm pretty proud of how it came out!
RAK/RAK0002430
Huh? ....You're proud of this?[nl]I kinda have a hard time believing it's actually a cookie....
CTG/CTG0003840
W-Well, sure. I was just daring to be different, y'know?[nl]I thought a normal cookie would look too amateurish.
RAK/RAK0002440
(Absolutely false....)
CTG/CTG0003850
Hey, Raku. Why aren't you moving?[nl]Are you saying you can't eat it, maybe?[nl]Even though it's your girlfriend's own cooking?
RAK/RAK0002450
Ghhh.....
RAK/RAK0002460
(What should I do....?)
Eat it
Don't eat it
RAK/RAK0002470
(Wait a sec! This could be really bad!)
RAK/RAK0002480
(Am I really going to put myself in mortal danger[nl] just for a moment of heroism? Am I really, really[nl] going to eat this!?)
Eat it
Give up
RAK/RAK0002490
(Wait, hold your horses. If I eat this,[nl] I might lose about 90% of my HP!)
RAK/RAK0002500
(Do I still think it's a good idea to eat this?)
Eat it like a man
RAK/RAK0002510
Ffffffff..........
RAK/RAK0002520
(Alright, I'm a man![nl] I'm ready.)
RAK/RAK0002530
D-Down the hatch....!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0003860
Yes! Please enjoy it!
RAK/RAK0002540
Nom....!
RAK/RAK0002550
Oh?
RAK/RAK0002560
The texture is more normal than I exp---
RAK/RAK0002570
GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[nl]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[nl]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!?!?
KSK/KSK0000410
I-Ichijo!?
SYU/SYU0000210
Hey, Raku!? What's wrong!?
RAK/RAK0002580
M-Mph thmphk mm mrph mf *mmph*[nl]stmphk, gmpht mmph smmph mphtmph!
KSK/KSK0000420
Ichijo! Have some water!
RAK/RAK0002590
Gaasp!
CTG/CTG0003870
Umm....perhaps....they weren't quite to your liking?
RAK/RAK0002600
"Not to my liking" doesn't even begin to describe them![nl]What the hell did you even put in these cookies!?
CTG/CTG0003880
Well, some rock salt, black pepper, some wasabi,[nl]a soda, and a little mustard....
RAK/RAK0002610
HUUUUH!?
CTG/CTG0003890
Hehe, I even threw in a secret ingredient.
RAK/RAK0002620
The heck you mean, secret ingredient!?[nl]That's the last thing a beginner cook[nl]should be putting in there!
RAK/RAK0002630
Heck, at this point, it isn't even food!
RAK/RAK0002640
(A human has their limits, after all....)
RAK/RAK0002650
Sorry, Chitoge. I really don't think I can eat this....
CTG/CTG0003900
Huuuuh!?
CTG/CTG0003910
W-What? You're saying the cookies I made are so bad[nl]that they're completely inedible!?
RAK/RAK0002660
Well, that about sums it up....
CTG/CTG0003920
That's terrible...! What the hell!?
CTG/CTG0003930
Hmph! I've had enough!
RAK/RAK0002670
H-Hey, Chitoge, where are you going!?[nl]Cooking class isn't even over yet!
CTG/CTG0003940
Shut up! Leave me alone, you stupid bean sprout![nl]Why don't you just stay here and eat Marika's cookies[nl]and mind your own business!?
@ＨＰ－１０
RAK/RAK0002680
Owww....!
RAK/RAK0002690
Jeez, what's with her....?[nl]I don't understand her.
SYU/SYU0000220
Hey, Raku. Don't you think you went a bit far?
RAK/RAK0002700
RUR/RUR0000320
Yes. Even if you were just being honest,[nl]even Chitoge would get mad at you for cutting her down[nl]like you just did.
RAK/RAK0002710
R-Really....?
KSK/KSK0000430
I....kind of understand how she feels.
KSK/KSK0000440
I think, since she worked so hard on her cookies,[nl]that she wanted you to recognize her efforts,[nl]even just a little bit.
RAK/RAK0002720
....!
RAK/RAK0002730
Do you think I hurt her feelings....?
SSR/SSR0000090
If you think so, why don't you go see her now?
SSR/SSR0000100
Just like her lover should.
MRK/MRK0000200
Well, if you ask me, you should stay here[nl]and drool over my cookies some more....
SSR/SSR0000110
Hey, don't butt in.
RAK/RAK0002740
Alright. I'm going to go find Chitoge[nl]and talk this out.
KSK/KSK0000450
Okay. I'll tell the teacher you both had to[nl]go do something urgent.
RAK/RAK0002750
Thanks, Onodera. I appreciate it.
RAK/RAK0002760
See ya....!
@フェードアウト
CTG/CTG0003950
Hahhhh. That didn't work after all.
CTG/CTG0003960
He likes animals, so I went to the trouble of[nl]making them in the shape of an animal....
CTG/CTG0003970
But they were too squished to be able to tell....
CTG/CTG0003980
Gawd, what a stupid bean sprout.[nl]He just doesn't get how I feel about what I make.
CTG/CTG0003990
....Hey, Ta-kun. You get how I'm feeling, right?
SNK/SNK0000060
Hisss.
CTG/CTG0004000
....Good boy. It's too bad about the leftover cookies,[nl]but here. You can have some.
SNK/SNK0000070
Kssh.
CTG/CTG0004010
Gahh, even the reptiles don't want them.[nl]How bad do you think my cookies are?
RAK/RAK0002770
Heeey, Chitoge!
CTG/CTG0004020
??
CTG/CTG0004030
What, so you followed me all the way out here?
RAK/RAK0002780
I want to talk to you about something.
CTG/CTG0004040
Hmph. I have nothing to say to you.[nl]Why don't you get back to cooking class?
RAK/RAK0002790
(Oh no....she's totally sulking.)
RAK/RAK0002800
(Anyway, I'd better get to apologizing[nl] for my outburst.)
