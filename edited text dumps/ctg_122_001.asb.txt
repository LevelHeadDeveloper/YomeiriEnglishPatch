Hey, Raku, what are some good games to teach a kid?
RAK/RAK0071340
....Games to teach a kid?
SYU/SYU0013560
I've got a relative's child coming over to play soon.[nl]Other than video games, I was wondering if you had[nl]any good ideas.
CTG/CTG0019820
For a child, huh....[nl]How about basketball or soccer? You guys like those, right?
@expose
SYU/SYU0013570
Well, we *do* like them.[nl]But we're not sure they'd be a good fit.[nl]She's a three-year old girl.
CTG/CTG0019830
A three-year old girl, huh.... What did I do to amuse myself[nl]when I was that age, I wonder....[nl]Hmmmmm, I don't remember!
RAK/RAK0071350
Let's see....[nl]This might be a bit old-fashioned,[nl]but how about cat's cradle?
SYU/SYU0013580
Oh, cat's cradle! That's good.[nl]It can get you really absorbed. Thank you, Raku!
RAK/RAK0071360
Yeah.
CTG/CTG0019840
....Hey.[nl]Cat's cradle....what is it?
RAK/RAK0071370
Ah. I see, so you don't know, Chitoge.
RAK/RAK0071380
Ummmm, do I have any string or something.....
RAK/RAK0071390
....Oh, I found some yarn in my sewing kit.
CTG/CTG0019850
....You carry a sewing kit around?
RAK/RAK0071400
I put it in there because I need it for home ec![nl]Just hold this string.
RAK/RAK0071410
Alright, now try moving your fingers the same way I do.
CTG/CTG0019860
O-Okay.
RAK/RAK0071420
....This one right here goes through there....
RAK/RAK0071430
And then....like that.
CTG/CTG0019870
....Huh? What was that wizardry just now!?[nl]Show me that move one more time!
RAK/RAK0071440
Like I said, you take this like this....[nl]Here, move your finger like so.[nl]Then it should come out looking like a ladder.
CTG/CTG0019880
....Whoa! It's just a loop, but it's amazing....![nl]Is there anything else you can do with this?
Make a tower
Two-player cat's cradle
RAK/RAK0071450
What, you like it?
CTG/CTG0019890
Yep! I've never seen anything like it!
RAK/RAK0071460
It doesn't feel too bad when you praise me that much.[nl]Alright, here's another one.
RAK/RAK0071470
This goes like that....there.[nl]Here! "Tokyo Watermelon Fishing"!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0019900
Amazing....![nl]So you can make something like that, too!
CTG/CTG0019910
Hey, hey, show me how to make that!
RAK/RAK0071480
Okay, okay, I'll show you, just relax.
RAK/RAK0071490
Cat's cradle isn't strictly a one-person activity,[nl]two people can do it too.
CTG/CTG0019920
Oooh, how do you do it? Can I do it too?
RAK/RAK0071500
Absolutely. One person holds the cat's cradle,[nl]and the other person has to try to take it from them.[nl]If it falls apart, you lose.
RAK/RAK0071510
Here, try to take it.
CTG/CTG0019930
Try to take it? What do I do?
RAK/RAK0071520
Pinch where the string crosses,[nl]wrap the inside around to the outside.... Then pull it up!
CTG/CTG0019940
....Like this?
RAK/RAK0071530
Yes, yes! See, you can do it.
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0019950
Hehehe....[nl]It might be fun to play these kinds of retro games sometimes.
RAK/RAK0071540
(I thought she was gonna say this was a bean-sprouty[nl] activity or something....[nl] I'm honestly surprised she enjoyed this.)
