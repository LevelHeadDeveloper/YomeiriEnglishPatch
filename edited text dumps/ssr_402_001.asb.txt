Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]Sorry I'm so late.
What held you up?
I just got here myself
@ssr_402_070
@expose
SSR/SSR0023880
Huh? Why was I late?[nl]Y-You see, umm....
SSR/SSR0023890
I got really nervous thinking about today.[nl]I couldn't get to sleep, but then I overslept....
SSR/SSR0023900
Hey, stop making me say weird stuff!
@ssr_402_071
SSR/SSR0023910
There's no need to say that for my sake.
SSR/SSR0023920
I can tell that's not true[nl]just from a brief listen to your heartbeat and pulse.
SSR/SSR0023930
But I do appreciate your thoughtfulness.[nl]Thank you.
@ssr_402_072
SSR/SSR0023940
So, did you have any[nl]particular plans for today?
[Let Tsugumi choose]
Go to the arcade
Go to the amusement park
Go shopping

SSR/SSR0023950
Okay then, how about we....[nl]go to the pool today, if you want?
@ssr_402_074
SSR/SSR0023960
I've heard about this one indoor[nl]pool in the neighborhood.[nl]I've been wanting to go there with you.
SSR/SSR0023970
Oh, and don't worry about not having a swimsuit.[nl]I'll rent one for you.
SSR/SSR0023980
Alright then, let's go.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0023990
It makes sense that it would[nl]be this empty during the off-season.
SSR/SSR0024000
....Hm? What's wrong?[nl]You've been staring at me for a while now.
Your swimsuit is cute
Could ya wear something sexier?
@ssr_402_075
SSR/SSR0024010
R-Really?
SSR/SSR0024020
If you say so, then it was worth[nl]the effort I put into picking it out.
SSR/SSR0024030
But don't stare too much, okay?[nl]This is embarrassing for me, too....
@ssr_402_076
SSR/SSR0024040
W-What are you saying, you idiot!?!?
SSR/SSR0024050
It took courage to wear even this swimsuit in front of you,[nl]and something sexier....
.......
SSR/SSR0024060
....If that's what you want,[nl]I'll see what I can do next time....
@ssr_402_077
SSR/SSR0024070
C-Can we stop talking about swimsuits now?[nl]Come on, let's get stretching!
@ssr_402_078
SSR/SSR0024080
Alright. Sit down with your back facing me.[nl]I'll give it a push.
SSR/SSR0024090
....You really are a boy, huh.[nl]Your back is so much more firm than mine.
SSR/SSR0024100
But the rest of you body seems firm, too.[nl]In a different way.
SSR/SSR0024110
Take a deep breath out and bend over more.[nl]It's too early to give up.
SSR/SSR0024120
Now that I've got control of your back,[nl]I'll put everything I've got into limbering you up.
I give up!
Turn the tables!
@ssr_402_079
SSR/SSR0024130
Hehe, maybe I teased you a bit much there.
SSR/SSR0024140
No need to force yourself.[nl]Stretch at your own pace.
@ssr_402_080
SSR/SSR0024150
Waaagh!?[nl]Don't stand up so suddenly!
SSR/SSR0024160
You want to switch places?[nl]That's fine, but....why are your hands twitching?
SSR/SSR0024170
....You're such a pervert.[nl]Just get back to your own stretching.
@ssr_402_081
SSR/SSR0024180
Okay, now that we've finished our stretches,[nl]we can finally get into the water.
SSR/SSR0024190
Speaking of which,[nl]how well would you say you can swim?
Well enough to teach, I hope
Not too well
@ssr_402_082
SSR/SSR0024200
Ohh....not what I expected.
SSR/SSR0024210
Then try to teach me.[nl]Let's see how good you are.
SSR/SSR0024220
Right, what should we practice first?
Flutter kick
Floating on the water
@ssr_402_083
SSR/SSR0024230
The flutter kick, huh....[nl]For that, you'll need to take my hands.
SSR/SSR0024240
....It's kind of embarrassing to be[nl]holding hands with you again....
@ssr_402_084
SSR/SSR0024250
Mhm. It's always important to go over the basics.
SSR/SSR0024260
So I start with a deep breath, like so, right?
SSR/SSR0024270
Like this?[nl]*inhaling*
SSR/SSR0024280
Hey, what are you looking at!?[nl]Quit ogling me, you perv!
@ssr_402_085
SSR/SSR0024290
Hmm. It was a nice and interesting[nl]change of pace for you to teach me.
SSR/SSR0024300
Not that it was really necessary....[nl]But once in a while it's not so bad to lean on you.
SSR/SSR0024310
Can we do this again sometime?
Sure
Can you teach me next?
@ssr_402_086
SSR/SSR0024320
Hehe....[nl]Then next time, you can teach me again.
SSR/SSR0024330
Make sure you do a good job for me.
@ssr_402_087
SSR/SSR0024340
Ohh?[nl]Then how about we get started on that now?
SSR/SSR0024350
I'll coach you rigorously. You'll be the fastest[nl]swimmer in the class when I'm through with you.
SSR/SSR0024360
Oh, hey! Don't think you can escape me[nl]by swimming away with form like *that*!
@ssr_402_088
SSR/SSR0024370
What? For real?
SSR/SSR0024380
Um.... Then if it wouldn't bother you,[nl]I could teach you....
Just kidding, I can swim
Please teach me!
@ssr_402_089
SSR/SSR0024390
Heh.... Very well.[nl]Leave it to me.
SSR/SSR0024400
Whenever you're ready, take my hands.[nl]I'll walk you through this step by step.
SSR/SSR0024410
Get yourself ready to swim.[nl]Heheheh....
@ssr_402_090
SSR/SSR0024420
Why would you tell such a stupid lie!?
SSR/SSR0024430
Good grief....[nl]Let's just swim around.
SSR/SSR0024440
How about we have a 25-meter swim race?[nl]If you win, you can make any one request of me.
Sound like fun
I'm not sure I could win
@ssr_402_091
SSR/SSR0024450
Hehe....[nl]You understand quite well.
SSR/SSR0024460
Then you should just accept my guidance graciously.[nl]I can teach you how to swim faster.
@ssr_402_092
SSR/SSR0024470
Hehehe....you've got nerve![nl]It's on, then!
@ssr_402_093
SSR/SSR0024480
Hahaha! Looks like I win after all!
SSR/SSR0024490
Hey, no need to feel so bad.[nl]It's because of all my combat experience.
SSR/SSR0024500
Well then, since we're here,[nl]I might as well teach you how to swim faster.
SSR/SSR0024510
Oop, don't do thinking you can escape from me.[nl]You lost, you don't get a choice.
SSR/SSR0024520
Now, take my hands.[nl]I'll walk you through this step by step.
SSR/SSR0024530
@ssr_402_094
SSR/SSR0024540
N-No way![nl]How could *I* have lost!?
@expose2
SSR/SSR0024550
Or rather....are you okay!?[nl]Your face is pale as a ghost!
SSR/SSR0024560
So you were really swimming that hard.[nl]....I guess I have to admit defeat.
SSR/SSR0024570
Is there anything you'd like for me to do,[nl]as your prize?
A kiss
Talk like a maid
@ssr_402_095
SSR/SSR0024580
W-Whaaat!?
SSR/SSR0024590
What the hell are you thinking!?[nl]Are you insane!? You must be!
SSR/SSR0024600
Ghh.... Stop giving me that look![nl]I can't believe you even thought about doing this....
SSR/SSR0024610
....Aaargh! Fine![nl]Close your eyes!
SSR/SSR0024620
*smooch*
SSR/SSR0024630
T-T-There we go![nl]It's not a problem if the kiss was on your hand, right!?
SSR/SSR0024640
W-What....?[nl]You were....joking!?
SSR/SSR0024650
TELL ME THIS STUFF SOONER, YOU IDIOOOTTTTT!
@ssr_402_096
SSR/SSR0024660
SSR/SSR0024670
Ghhh.... I want to punch you right now,[nl]but a loss is a loss.
SSR/SSR0024680
V....very well, Master....
SSR/SSR0024690
Hey, quit laughing, this was your idea!
@ssr_402_097
@フェードアウト
SSR/SSR0024700
I had fun today.
SSR/SSR0024710
It's certainly been a while[nl]since I had a swim this nice.
SSR/SSR0024720
But I have to go home now....
@ssr_402_097_1
Let's go to the beach next time
I had fun too
@ssr_402_098
@expose
SSR/SSR0024730
The beach, huh....[nl]Not a bad idea.
SSR/SSR0024740
We can take a beach ball[nl]and a watermelon when we go, as well.
SSR/SSR0024750
I'd like to play like a normal girl would,[nl]like the Mistress or Mistress Onodera.
SSR/SSR0024760
Of course....with just us two.
@ssr_402_099
SSR/SSR0024770
I see. That's good.
SSR/SSR0024780
When summer rolls around, I want to go[nl]to a bigger pool.
SSR/SSR0024790
I've heard the Lazy River and waterslides[nl]at those pools are fun.
SSR/SSR0024800
Let's go together sometime.
SSR/SSR0024810
I want to make more memories with you.
@ssr_402_100
SSR/SSR0024820
It looks like we're going the same way for now.
SSR/SSR0024830
As long as we're both here, walk next to me.[nl]That would me more....d-date-like, right?
@ssr_402_101
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0024840
Today was a lot of fun.[nl]Thanks for going out with me.
@ssr_402_102
SSR/SSR0024850
Next time, let's go somewhere *you* want to go.[nl]I'm looking forward to it.
SSR/SSR0024860
Well then....see you later.
@マジコイ終了処理
@ssr_402_103
SSR/SSR0024870
Well then....
See ya round!
I'll walk you home.
@ssr_402_104
SSR/SSR0024880
Yup, see you around.
SSR/SSR0024890
Next time, let's go somewhere *you* want to go.[nl]I'm looking forward to it.
@ssr_402_105
SSR/SSR0024900
Huh!?
SSR/SSR0024910
No, I appreciate the thought, but....
SSR/SSR0024920
If Claude found out, there could be trouble.[nl]I'll be fine for today.
SSR/SSR0024930
Thank you.[nl]This is exactly the sort of reason I....
SSR/SSR0024940
....l-like....you.
Thank you
Didn't quite catch that
@ssr_402_106
SSR/SSR0024950
I-It's not like you need to thank me.
SSR/SSR0024960
Okay, see you later!
@ssr_402_107
SSR/SSR0024970
I said I l-li....
SSR/SSR0024980
Aaaaargh! I can only say something[nl]that embarrassing so many times!
SSR/SSR0024990
You're pretending not to hear me on purpose![nl]You're so mean!
SSR/SSR0025000
Ghh.... If I stay around you for another second[nl]I'm afraid I'll say something *else* weird.
