If you'd been cooperating with Maiko,[nl]your wallet would be a lot better off, huh.
RUR/RUR0004730
Well, I certainly haven't noticed[nl]any improvements in your finances lately.
RUR/RUR0004740
But that's just circumstantial evidence.

RUR/RUR0004750
You're saying that because you're not with Maiko right now,[nl]that you're not working with him?

RUR/RUR0004780
No proof, huh.

In light of what you've done before,[nl]I can't help but be suspicious.
