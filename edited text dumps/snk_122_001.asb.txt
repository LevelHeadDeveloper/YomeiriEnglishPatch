Roger.[nl]....Hey, how come you're not out of breath[nl]from climbing the stairs?

What are you talking about?[nl]It's not just a series of bumps in a corridor.[nl]It's a lot easier to run when there's no one around.

I really don't understand your logic....
RAK/RAK0082880
Anyway, I'll see you there.
