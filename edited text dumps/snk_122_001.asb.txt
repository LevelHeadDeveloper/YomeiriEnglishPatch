Hello.[nl]I'm on my way up the stairs now.

Roger.[nl]....Hey, how come you're not out of breath[nl]from climbing the stairs?

What are you talking about?[nl]It's just a hallway, but bumpier.[nl]Besides, there's no one here, so it's easier to run fast.
RAK/RAK0082870
I really don't understand your logic....
RAK/RAK0082880
Anyway, I'll see you there.
