CTG/CTG0010350
Woahhh, we're finally *heeeeere*![nl]I'm so freaking excited!
SSR/SSR0010440
Yes.... I didn't think I'd have the opportunity to[nl]travel with both Mistress Onodera and you, Mistress,[nl]so I'm very happy.
KSK/KSK0008830
And it's all thanks to Ichijo for winning that raffle![nl]Thanks, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0036390
Nah, I just happened to get lucky.
RUR/RUR0007580
Thanks for coming to see us off, Maiko.[nl]You're going to walk all the way home from here?
SYU/SYU0006040
Ha ha ha.[nl]That joke hurt a bit, Ruri.
MRK/MRK0009070
You all took a field trip to a forest not unlike[nl]this one, right?  I daresay I'm jealous.
RAK/RAK0036400
Oh, that's right. That was before[nl]you transferred to our school.
@expose2
MRK/MRK0009080
Yes. But this time around, I'm also going to make[nl]all kinds of wonderful memories with my darling Raku![nl]....Just us two, of course.★
RAK/RAK0036410
Huh!? H-Hey. Don't get so close!
CTG/CTG0010360
Hey....Marika![nl]Why the hell are you always....[nl]Get off of Raku THIS INSTANT!
@expose
MRK/MRK0009090
Aah! Oh my goodness, Kirisaki, you're so forceful.
CTG/CTG0010370
I know you're not talking!
RAK/RAK0036420
H-Hey, hey....
RAK/RAK0036430
Huh? Tsugumi?[nl]Why are you looking at me like that....?
SSR/SSR0010450
....I should probably warn you.[nl]Master Claude has given me strict orders to kill you if you[nl]lay so much as a finger on the Mistress during this trip.
SSR/SSR0010460
So you'd better not even think about pulling something.
RAK/RAK0036440
Y-Yes, ma'am....
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0036450
....Alright, we'll be having curry and rice for lunch.[nl]First up, we'll....
CTG/CTG0010380
Huhhh? That's the same thing we had on the field trip.[nl]Why don't we have something different?
RAK/RAK0036460
N-No.... I just really like curry![nl]I'm sorry, but I really wanna eat curry today.
CTG/CTG0010390
Is that right?[nl]Well, I guess that's okay then.
RAK/RAK0036470
Anyway, listen up! Chitoge, you cook the rice; Onodera[nl]and Miyamoto, you two gather firewood; and Tachibana and[nl]Tsugumi, you guys chop the vegetables. Let's get to work!
CTG/CTG0010400G
Okaaaay!
SYU/SYU0006050
You seem desperate, buddy.
RAK/RAK0036480
Yeah, you should be grateful.
RAK/RAK0036490
(Alright, who should I go check on first?)
@rak_002_101_sel
@2ショット開始
RAK/RAK0036500
Chitoge, how're you holding up?[nl]I hope you haven't already burned yourself.
CTG/CTG0010410
So rude. It's going perfectly![nl]It's only my second time doing this, but I think I'm[nl]getting the hang of it, right?
RAK/RAK0036510
Yeah, that's good to hear.
CTG/CTG0010420
Heheee. Naturally.
RAK/RAK0036520
Seems like you're having fun.
CTG/CTG0010430
W-Well, sure.... Is that so bad?[nl]I'm having a good time hanging out with everyone....
RAK/RAK0036530
That's great.
RAK/RAK0036540
Wait, AAAAAAAGH![nl]There's a column of fire! Put it out, put it oouuuut!
CTG/CTG0010440
WAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH![nl]Water! WAAATEEERRRRR!
RAK/RAK0036890
(I already went to check on Chitoge.)
RAK/RAK0036550
Onodera, everything going well?
KSK/KSK0008850
Yep. We've got a bunch of firewood.
SDG/SDG0000020
Grrrrrrr......
RAK/RAK0036560
Gah!? A stray dog!?
RAK/RAK0036570
Onodera! For your own safety, don't move a muscle!
KSK/KSK0008860
Huh? It's okaaay.[nl]Look. Here, girl!
SDG/SDG0000030
*pant pant pant*[nl]*whine*
KSK/KSK0008870
Awww, how cute.[nl]Hahaha, that tickles!
RAK/RAK0036580
(I can't believe she can even tame[nl] a stray dog. Onodera's amazing....)
RAK/RAK0036900
(I wouldn't mind going to see Onodera again....[nl] But I don't want to bother her too many times.)
RAK/RAK0036590
Tsugumi, you're working fast.[nl]You've already cut all these?
SSR/SSR0010480
I'm very good at cutting things.[nl]You can count on me.
SSR/SSR0010490
....Oogh.
RAK/RAK0036600
Huh? ....What's wrong!?[nl]Why are you crying all of a sudden!?
SSR/SSR0010500
It's just....it stings....
RAK/RAK0036610
Huh?[nl]Like as in....human kindness stings your heart?
SSR/SSR0010510
What are you talking about?[nl]I was talking about the onions making my eyes sting.
RAK/RAK0036620
....Oh, so that's it.[nl]Sorry, I got carried away thinking about enka....
SSR/SSR0010520
Hmph.
SSR/SSR0010530
But, like I mentioned before, I never thought I'd be able[nl]to have an experience like this with the Mistress again.
SSR/SSR0010540
Or you, either....
RAK/RAK0036630
Huh?
SSR/SSR0010550
I-I'm just trying to say I'm grateful![nl]I'm, well....enjoying this as much as possible.
RAK/RAK0036640
I see. That's good to hear.
RAK/RAK0036920
(I think Tsugumi can handle herself[nl] if I don't check on her again.)
RAK/RAK0036650
Tachibana. How's it goi--
MRK/MRK0009110
Raku dearessssst!
RAK/RAK0036660
Aaagh, careful![nl]Don't hug me when you've got a knife in your hand!
MRK/MRK0009120
Oh my, I do apologize.
RAK/RAK0036670
Sheesh....
RAK/RAK0036680
Though you did as well I thought you would, Tachibana.[nl]You're great at cutting vegetables.
MRK/MRK0009130
Hehe, I'm so happy to receive such praise from you,[nl]Raku dearest!
MRK/MRK0009140
If you'd like, maybe you could[nl]join me in cutting these?
RAK/RAK0036690
Alright. Great.[nl]Okay then, I'll peel these potatoes.
MRK/MRK0009150
Yes, thank you very much.[nl]That would be a big help.
MRK/MRK0009160
As we're doing this, I can't help but think about[nl]what it will be like once we get married.
RAK/RAK0036700
Uh, I don't think I could make such a big leap....
RAK/RAK0036710
....Oh.
RAK/RAK0036720
Hold still, Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0009170
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0009180
Raku dearest, why are you getting closer---?
RAK/RAK0036730
Don't move.
MRK/MRK0009190
H-Huuhhh!?
MRK/MRK0009200
Ummm.... T-This ain't no good!
RAK/RAK0036740
Alright, got it.
MRK/MRK0009210
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0036750
There was a leaf on your head.[nl]I got it off for you in one fell swoop.
MRK/MRK0009220
Jeez....[nl]That's just plain unfair, Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0036910
(Tachibana, huh....[nl] Knowing her, she's probably fine by herself.)
RUR/RUR0007590
Oh, Ichijo. Something wrong?
RAK/RAK0036760
No, I'm just here to help.
RUR/RUR0007600
Oh, I see.
RUR/RUR0007610
Tch. Why aren't you going to see Kosaki instead?
RAK/RAK0036770
RUR/RUR0007620
Nothing at all.[nl]I'm just looking for some edible mushrooms right now.
RAK/RAK0036780
Oohh, that's pretty cool.[nl]You can tell them apart from the poisonous ones?
RUR/RUR0007630
Yep. Those ones are poisonous,[nl]and those ones safe to eat.
RUR/RUR0007640
In fact, you can even eat this kind raw.[nl]Want to taste one?
RAK/RAK0036790
Hmmm. Sure, I'll try one.
RAK/RAK0036800
Nom....
RUR/RUR0007650
Oh, this is bad.[nl]Those ones were actually poisonous after all!
RAK/RAK0036810
BLAAAGH!
RUR/RUR0007660
Just kidding.[nl]I wouldn't make a mistake like that.
RAK/RAK0036820
M-Miyamoto, you stinker....![nl]Why the hell would you do that!?
RUR/RUR0007670
RAK/RAK0036930
(I'm not falling for that again,[nl] and I trust Miyamoto to not do anything dumb.)
SYU/SYU0006060
What are you doing, coming to where I am?
RAK/RAK0036830
That's my line. What is it you're[nl]doing in this spot?
SYU/SYU0006070
Heheh.... There are times when a man must act.[nl]Well, just have a look and see what I'm talking about.
SYU/SYU0006080
From where we are right now, we can see every[nl]move the girls are making, right?
RAK/RAK0036840
....Well, it seems like it.
SYU/SYU0006090
Doesn't it feel like your heart is being washed clean?[nl]Well, comrade....?
RAK/RAK0036850
Don't call me comrade. Forget that, help me out....
RAK/RAK0036940
(I'd better just leave him to himself.)
RAK/RAK0036860
(There's no use just standing here....)
RAK/RAK0036870
(Alright, who should I check on next....?)

RAK/RAK0036950G
Thank you for the meal.
RAK/RAK0036960
Ahhh, that curry was amazing.[nl]
SYU/SYU0006110
It was all thanks to your brilliant leadership.[nl]Good job, Raku!
RAK/RAK0036970
Thanks, man.
CTG/CTG0010460
Hey, hey, what should we all do for fun now?
SYU/SYU0006120
Heheheheheh.... I've been waiting for this moment.[nl]As long as we're here, we should play cards again!
RAK/RAK0036980
You've got those with you again....
SYU/SYU0006130
Of course! We didn't get to finish last time.[nl]This time, we gotta make sure we play with a good penalty!
KSK/KSK0008890
A-A penalty!?
CTG/CTG0010470
You don't mean....
SYU/SYU0006140
Yes, indeeeeed! Exactly that one!
RAK/RAK0036990
(Ghh! Not the one where the loser[nl] has to say their first crush!?)
SSR/SSR0010570
W-W-What....did you....
MRK/MRK0009240
Heheheh....[nl]I won't lose!
SYU/SYU0006150
Alright, let's hurry up and get started![nl]The game is Old Maid, just like last time.
SYU/SYU0006170
So, it ended up another showdown between Raku[nl]and Kirisaki. Man, you two are bad at this.
RAK/RAK0037000G
Shaddup!
CTG/CTG0010490
I'm not going to lose....![nl]Hurry up and take a card!
Tap the card you want!
CTG/CTG0010500
-----!
RAK/RAK0037010
(This one must not be the joker....)
RAK/RAK0037020
(What do I do? Should I take it?)
Keep thinking
Take it
RAK/RAK0037070
(Sorry, but I can't lose this![nl] ....Goodbye, Chitoge!)
CTG/CTG0010510
----
RAK/RAK0037030
(This one must be the joker....)
RAK/RAK0037040
(What do I do? Should I take it anyway?)
RAK/RAK0037050
(Samurai's mercy. Just this one time.)
RAK/RAK0037060
(Alright, bring it![nl] It's a one-on-one fight!)
CTG/CTG0010520
GAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
RAK/RAK0037080
Phew. I managed to survive somehow!
CTG/CTG0010530
Aaaaaaaaaaaa....!![nl]This....this wasn't supposed to happen....!
SYU/SYU0006180
Alright then, Kirisaki,[nl]let's get straight to the penalty!
CTG/CTG0010540
U-Ummmm.....[nl]Uhhhhhhhh.....!?
CTG/CTG0010550
M-My.....
CTG/CTG0010560
CTG/CTG0010570
My....first love was....!
RAK/RAK0037090
....Okay, the penalty is that the loser[nl]has to clean up after dinner.
CTG/CTG0010580
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0037100
Has anyone else already said what the penalty should be?
RAK/RAK0037110
I'll help out too, so let's go with that.
RAK/RAK0037120
Is that okay, Shuu?
SYU/SYU0006190
Nyahahaha. Since it's you, Raku,[nl]I'll let this one slide.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0010590
RAK/RAK0037130
GAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0010600
Alriiiiiight![nl]I wooooooon!
RAK/RAK0037140
I-I lost.....!
SYU/SYU0006200
Alright then, Raku,[nl]let's get straight to the penalty!
RAK/RAK0037150
N-Nggghhh.....[nl]Nggghhghghgh.....
RAK/RAK0037160
M-My....
RAK/RAK0037170
RAK/RAK0037180
My....first love was....!
RAK/RAK0037190
(Wait, how am I supposed to tell them about it, dammit!?)
CTG/CTG0010610
Alright, so the penalty was that you have to[nl]clean up after dinner, right?
RAK/RAK0037200
CTG/CTG0010620
Has anyone else already said what the penalty should be?
CTG/CTG0010630
I'll help out too, so....[nl]Is that alright, Maiko?
SYU/SYU0006210
Nyahahaha. You're so kind, Kirisaki.
SYU/SYU0006220
Well, I'm not really interested in hearing[nl]a guy's love stories anyway. Why don't we listen to Kirisaki[nl]and let this one go?
CTG/CTG0010640
Well, that's that, then.[nl]Shall we, Raku?
RAK/RAK0037210
Y-Yeah.... Thanks, Chitoge.
MRK/MRK0009250
In that case, I'll help you clean up too, Raku dearest!
CTG/CTG0010650
You won, so it doesn't matter!
KSK/KSK0008900
SSR/SSR0010580
I won't leave you to do the dishes, Mistress![nl]I suppose I'll help out too....!
SYU/SYU0006230
Ahh, this is a bittersweet scene,[nl]but what everyone really looks forward to after dinner is....
SYU/SYU0006240
Ta-daaaa! Let's do some fireworks!
RUR/RUR0007690
You really are ready for anything.
CTG/CTG0010660
Come on, quit dawdling already![nl]This'll go a lot faster if we just throw water on the ashes!
RAK/RAK0037220
W-W-W-W-W-Wait![nl]It says here we shouldn't do that!
CTG/CTG0010670
Ghh....
RAK/RAK0037230
Jeez.... Here, lemme see that.[nl]You're not used to doing this sort of thing, right?
CTG/CTG0010680
I-It can't be helped.[nl]I guess I'll let you do it.
CTG/CTG0010690
Thanks....
RAK/RAK0037240
Yeah, yeah.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0010700
CTG/CTG0010710
Oh....Hey, Raku![nl]Look up, quick!
RAK/RAK0037250
Wowww.... There's stars everywhere.
CTG/CTG0010720
Amaaaaazing!
CTG/CTG0010730
Hey, Raku. Find me a shooting star or two,[nl]and tell me when you see them.
RAK/RAK0037260
Don't be ridiculous. Even if I did that, it'd be gone[nl]by the time I told you it was there. Besides, you've got better[nl]eyesight than me.
CTG/CTG0010740
Oh. I guess you're right. Hahaha.
RAK/RAK0037270
Haha.
RAK/RAK0037280
....You seemed to really enjoy yourself today.
RAK/RAK0037290
We should come back sometime.
CTG/CTG0010750
We should. And next time it should just be you and....
CTG/CTG0010760
RAK/RAK0037300
....What'dja say?
CTG/CTG0010770
....Never mind.
CTG/CTG0010780
Oh, a shooting star!
RAK/RAK0037310
....Ohh!? Amazing, I see it too!
