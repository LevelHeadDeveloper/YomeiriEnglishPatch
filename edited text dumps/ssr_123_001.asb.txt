Cough! Cough!!
RAK/RAK0056490
Hey, hey, your face is all white.[nl]What are you doing, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0015960
Cough.... I'm on cleaning detail today,[nl]and I have to clean the blackboard....
SSR/SSR0015970
But I'm not very good at clapping these erasers....[nl]Every time I try, I just end up covered in chalk dust.
RAK/RAK0056500
Why not just use the eraser cleaner over there?
SSR/SSR0015980
What....?
RAK/RAK0056510
If you use that to suck the dust off them,[nl]you won't need to clap them.
SSR/SSR0015990
S-So that's.....what that box was for!?[nl]I thought that was a self-destruct box for emergencies....
RAK/RAK0056520
Why would it be!?
SSR/SSR0016000
So if I use this, the erasers will be cleaned?
RAK/RAK0056530
Exactly. Go ahead and use it right now.
SSR/SSR0016010
O-Okay.
SSR/SSR0016020
Okay, I'm turning it on....
SSR/SSR0016030
....Woooooooaaaaaah!
SSR/SSR0016040
Amazing! That's amazing![nl]They're just like new in no time flat!
SSR/SSR0016050
Lemme try this on the board.....oohh![nl]Beautiful!
RAK/RAK0056540
....I wasn't expecting you to be so pleased.
RAK/RAK0056550
But you've really been clapping erasers this whole time, huh.[nl]Man....you're kinda clumsy in a weird way.
SSR/SSR0016060
I-It can't be helped. If it wasn't for this mission,[nl]I'd have never have been to school at all.[nl]I've never been to a normal school before.
RAK/RAK0056560
I see.... That sounds rough.
RAK/RAK0056570
If you have any other questions about school, just ask.[nl]You can ask me, Chitoge, or any of the others.
SSR/SSR0016070
Mhm....okay. I think I'll take you up on that, then.
RAK/RAK0056580
(She's a lot more straightforward than she was at first.)
RAK/RAK0056590
Oh, hang on. There's some chalk on your face.
SSR/SSR0016080
Hm?

Wha...!? W-W-What are you doing!?
RAK/RAK0056600
Well, there was some chalk dust on your face,[nl]so I wiped it off.

---!!
RAK/RAK0056610
Hm? Your face is red now? Don't tell me you[nl]got red chalk on it, too?
SSR/SSR0016110
Y-You idiot! Why the hell would I feel bashful around you!?
RAK/RAK0056620
Huh? Bashful?
SSR/SSR0016120
Hey! No more![nl]Don't come near me, don't touch me, don't talk to meeee!
RAK/RAK0056630
H-Huh? Did I do something to make you mad?[nl]What the.... You were in a good mood just now.
RAK/RAK0056640
(Hahh.... I'll never understand women....)

SSR/SSR0016130
Kyaah!
SSR/SSR0016140
You! What are you doing!?
RAK/RAK0056670
N-No, sorry, I made a mistake!
RAK/RAK0056680
(This is no time to play around....)
SSR/SSR0016150
You've been all over me over and over for a while now![nl]I won't allow any more!
RAK/RAK0056690
W-Wait! Let's talk this over, you'll understand!
SSR/SSR0016160
