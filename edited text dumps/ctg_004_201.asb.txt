Maybe instead of our regular date, we could do a[nl]cooking class for a nice change of pace....?[nl]Yes, I'm already starting to get a little excited.
RAK/RAK0002810
I'll warn you now, I don't go easy with my teaching.[nl]I won't hold back.
CTG/CTG0004490
Don't underestimate my resolve.[nl]I'll make something so delicious, your taste buds[nl]will cry tears of joy.
RAK/RAK0002820
So you say, bastard.
RAK/RAK0002830
Well, anyway, we'd better get back to cooking class.[nl]People might be getting worried.

CTG/CTG0004500
Yeah.

RAK/RAK0002840
Hey, stop sulking so much.
CTG/CTG0004510
I'm not sulking at all.
CTG/CTG0004520
I'm just broken-hearted because everyone treated me[nl]like a terrible cook.
RAK/RAK0002850
But isn't that sulking?
CTG/CTG0004530
Anyway! I'm not going back. Not until I can find[nl]at least ONE of these guys who will eat[nl]and enjoy my cookies.
RAK/RAK0002860
You came here to try to get the animals[nl]to eat your failed cookies?
CTG/CTG0004540
Y-Yeah! Is that wrong!?[nl]They're the only ones who seem to approve of my cooking!
CTG/CTG0004550
Well, Ta-kun hates me now....
RAK/RAK0002870
Pffft....!
CTG/CTG0004560
D-Don't laugh! Stupid bean sprout....
RAK/RAK0002880
No, don't get angry.
RAK/RAK0002890
Don't worry. Onodera, Miyamoto, and the rest of them[nl]all appreciated your effort.
CTG/CTG0004570
Huh? R-Really?
RAK/RAK0002900
Yeah, so you don't need to keep groveling.
CTG/CTG0004580
Hmmmm..... Well, let's head back.
CTG/CTG0004590
Even if you don't appreciate me, Raku,[nl]I'm glad at least Kosaki and the others do.
RAK/RAK0002910
Well, it's not as though I don't[nl]appreciate you, ya know?
RAK/RAK0002920
Well, as long as you're feeling better, it's fine.
CTG/CTG0004600
Hey, Raku, will Kosaki and the others taste my cookies?
CTG/CTG0004610
We'll ask them to when we get back.
RAK/RAK0002930
No, don't do that....

Oh, you two! Welcome back~!
CTG/CTG0004620
Sorry, guys, I had to go do something.[nl]How's class going?
RUR/RUR0000330
Well, that's the thing....[nl]We had a bit of a problem after you two left.
CTG/CTG0004630
Problem?
KSK/KSK0000460
I don't know how, but at some point the cookies[nl]you made disappeared right from under our noses.[nl]Only the plate was left.
CTG/CTG0004640
Huh!? What's this!?[nl]You mean somebody stole them and ate them!?
SSR/SSR0000120
No, I didn't see any scoundrels try and pull that....
MRK/MRK0000210
It's kind of funny how the cookies could just[nl]disappear into thin air like that.
RAK/RAK0002940
Disappear into....thin air?
RAK/RAK0002950
(Don't tell me....)
CTG/CTG0004650
Raku? Where are you going?
