So you accidentally lent one of Maiko's[nl]peeping videos to Chitoge.
RUR/RUR0002180
When you realized your mistake, you hurriedly sneaked[nl]into her house to swap it out with a real copy[nl]of "Meowsville 2".
RUR/RUR0002190
You managed to reach her room,[nl]but I found you at the last second.
RAK/RAK0029010
Yes, that's more or less what happened....
RUR/RUR0002200
Jeez. I'm completely dumbfounded.
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0002210
Well, I'll give you credit for being honest[nl]and not trying to mislead me.
RAK/RAK0029020
Anyway, that's all.
@rur_002_201_02
RUR/RUR0002220
I guess there's no point in any more questioning.[nl]Let me just call Chitoge's family.
RAK/RAK0029030
W-Wait a sec![nl]T-That's....
RUR/RUR0002230
Well then, should I call Kosaki and the others first?
RAK/RAK0029040
Eeeeeek!
RAK/RAK0029050
(I'm at my limit![nl] Sorry, Shuu!)
RAK/RAK0029060
I understand....[nl]I will....confess everything....

Maiko's super-special video?
RAK/RAK0029070
Yeah, exactly....
@rur_002_201_03
RAK/RAK0029080
There wasn't anything else I could do,[nl]other than sneak in here....
RUR/RUR0002250
I thought it was strange that you'd do something[nl]so stupid when you're normally so earnest,[nl]but I guess Maiko was behind this the whole time.
RAK/RAK0029090
For some reason, I haven't been able to reach him[nl]over the phone for a while now....[nl]He's ditched me, hasn't he?
RUR/RUR0002260
Well, I'll make sure he pays for this DVD---
RUR/RUR0002270
For now, Ichijo, leave the real Meowsville 2[nl]and get the hell outta here.
RAK/RAK0029100
Huh? You're letting me go?
RUR/RUR0002280
What's the point of beating you up[nl]if you're only half involved?
RUR/RUR0002290
Instead, I'll have you make it up to me[nl]somehow next time. You'd better be prepared.
RAK/RAK0029110
S-Sure! No problem!
RUR/RUR0002300
I'll smash this DVD to smithereens in secret....[nl]Come on, you'd better get going.
RAK/RAK0029120
Oh, thanks. You're actually pretty nice....
RUR/RUR0002320
I don't accept compliments from trespassers.
RAK/RAK0029130
Hahaha, you got me there....[nl]Well then, I owe you one, Miyamoto!
RUR/RUR0002330
Oh, that's right. Ichijo, can you[nl]tell Maiko something when you see him?
RAK/RAK0029140
Huh?
@expose2
RUR/RUR0002340
Tell him:[nl]"Starting tomorrow, think of your human rights [nl]as nonexistent". Hehehehe.....
RAK/RAK0029150
(Scary....!)
