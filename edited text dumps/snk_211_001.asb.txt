Mgh....who were those guys?
MRK/MRK0008650
Whoever they were, it's nice to see they're gone.[nl]They were getting in the way of our cleaining.
RAK/RAK0031520
Tsugumi, Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0008660
Yaaay, Raku dearest! â˜…
RUR/RUR0005270
You guys are on cleaning duty?
SSR/SSR0009850
Yeah. But since someone got in the way earlier,[nl]we haven't made much progress.
RAK/RAK0031530
Someone who gets in the way....[nl]Was it Shuu?
MRK/MRK0008670
Yes. Maiko and a bunch of guys following him.[nl]I really wonder what on earth they were up to.
SSR/SSR0009860
They exchanged items in a shady, hidden manner,[nl]and they left as soon as they were done....[nl]It was reminiscient of a drug deal.
MRK/MRK0008680
Hey, Raku dearest.[nl]Who on earth were they?
MRK/MRK0008690
They looked at me and muttered[nl]something like "Josephine from the infirmary"[nl]or something like that....
SSR/SSR0009870
For me it was "she'd make a great[nl]servant if she undressed"....[nl]I don't know what that means.
RAK/RAK0031540
(There were some backstage photos[nl] from the Culture Festival in the booklet, right....)
RUR/RUR0005280
Hey, you two.[nl]Do you know where Maiko went?
SSR/SSR0009880
Yes, I do. He said "I'm going back to the classroom next".
RAK/RAK0031550
What the hell, so we're back to square one!?
RUR/RUR0005290
It can't be helped.[nl]Let's go back to room 1-C.
RAK/RAK0031560
Tsugumi, Tachibana, sorry for interrupting.
MRK/MRK0008700
Oh, wait, Raku dearest![nl]Wait for me!
SSR/SSR0009890
We're still cleaning.
MRK/MRK0008710
Mghhh!
