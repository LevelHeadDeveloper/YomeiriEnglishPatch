Hm, a phone call....?
RAK/RAK0081930
Hello?
MRK/MRK0018790
Hello, Raku dearest.[nl]Sorry to disturb you at this hour, but this is Marika.
RAK/RAK0081940
Oh, Tachibana?[nl]What do you need this late?
MRK/MRK0018800
Do you have any plans for the weekend, Raku dearest?
RAK/RAK0081950
Plans?[nl]I don't think I had anything specific in mind....
MRK/MRK0018810
Well, then![nl]In that case, how about we get together and hang out?[nl]We can have ourselves a date. ♪
RAK/RAK0081960
Dude....[nl]I'm already dating Chitoge.
MRK/MRK0018820
There's no rule that says you can't spend[nl]time with someone who isn't your girlfriend.
MRK/MRK0018830
Besides....as long as she doesn't find out,[nl]there's no problem, right?
RAK/RAK0081970
I don't wanna stoop that low.
MRK/MRK0018840
Mghh.... That's my darling Raku for you.[nl]Always so tough and cool.
MRK/MRK0018850
Well then, I don't mind if you just spend time with me![nl]As long as it's not date-like, you'll be okay with it, right?
RAK/RAK0081980
That's, well....[nl]Maybe.
MRK/MRK0018860
Then it's settled![nl]I'll pick you up at your house on our next day off school,[nl]thank you very much, and I'll see you then!
RAK/RAK0081990
Whaaa!? It's been settled already!?
MRK/MRK0018870
I can't wait to hang out with you, Raku dearest!
RAK/RAK0082000
....Jeez, you never listen when I have something to say.[nl]Alright, I'll do it just this once.
RAK/RAK0082010
But....d-don't do anything weird, okay?
MRK/MRK0018880
Hehe, I wouldn't dream of it, Raku dearest.[nl]And it's typically the lady that has to have that kind[nl]of caution, right?
MRK/MRK0018890
Anyway, we're hanging out this weekend for sure![nl]You promise?
RAK/RAK0082020
Alright, alright. I promise, so get to bed already.[nl]We can't have you being over-tired tomorrow.
MRK/MRK0018900
Copy that. ♪[nl]Well then, have a good night.
RAK/RAK0082030
Yeah, good night.
MRK/MRK0018910
I love you, Raku dearest. ★[nl]*smooch*
