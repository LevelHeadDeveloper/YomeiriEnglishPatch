You're too slow, Raku Ichijo! Had this been a real battle,[nl]your comrades would have long since left you behind!
RAK/RAK0082960
Yeah, but that being said....[nl]I intend to live my life on the straight and narrow[nl]to avoid having to be in a real battle.
SSR/SSR0021530
What a naive thing to say![nl]Danger lurks around every corner!
SSR/SSR0021540
For example....[nl]Recently, I went out to eat some fish.
SSR/SSR0021550
I thought it would be a normal restaurant,[nl]but this place was outrageous.
RAK/RAK0082970
What do you mean?
SSR/SSR0021560
Mhm. When I asked the owner what he recommended,[nl]he gave me a creepy smile, and he said in a mousy, wheedling voice:
SSR/SSR0021570
"Customer-san, right now it's *gun* season!!"
RAK/RAK0082980
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0021580
Sensing that I was in danger, I broke through the window[nl]and jumped outside to escape. Had I stayed in that restaurant,[nl]I would definitely have been killed.
RAK/RAK0082990
You know, that's....
SSR/SSR0021590
Even in a country like this, which is said to be the[nl]safest in the world, there's a lot of very dangerous places![nl]Remember that very well!

(When he said "gun", was he just talking about pufferfish....?[nl] I-I won't tell her. Now's not the time....)[nl] #fs{12}TN: The word used is "teppou", which means "gun" and is slang for "pufferfish".#fs{}
