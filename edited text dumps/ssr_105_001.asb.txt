Aah, I know it's kind of sudden,[nl]but I'm gonna be searching everyone's bags.

MSA/MSA0000160G
HUUUHH!?!?
KYK/KYK0000410
I don't wanna do it either. But some of our students[nl]are bringing in games, magazines, a lot of sweets.....[nl]Well, all kinds of things like that.
KYK/KYK0000420
So I'll be going around the room, so just[nl]leave your bag on your desk and wait for me.[nl]It'll be done in no time.
RAK/RAK0053490
An unannounced bag inspection....[nl]None of you brought anything that isn't allowed, right?
SYU/SYU0008840
Aaagh! I'll put this DVD over here,[nl]and hide this photo album behind my desk.....
RUR/RUR0011710
Sh....Sh sh sh sh.....
KSK/KSK0016710
Ruri, stop bringing so many sweets to hide!
RAK/RAK0053500
(They're all packing contraband!)
CTG/CTG0013860
Hey, hey, Raku![nl]Doesn't this seem like it could go sour?
RAK/RAK0053510
Hm? How come, Chitoge?[nl]Did you bring something weird with you, too?
CTG/CTG0013870
Not me! Tsugumi!!
RAK/RAK0053520
Tsugumi....? Ah!
KYK/KYK0000430
Alright, next up is Tsugumi.
RAK/RAK0053530
She's always pointing weapons at me and Shuu,[nl]and I'm pretty sure she has them on her today, as well....
CTG/CTG0013880
How could she not have that kind of equipment?[nl]....She's probably armed to the teeth.
CTG/CTG0013890
The class seems to think all her weapons are toys,[nl]but if they find out they're real....[nl]She could be expelled, right?
RAK/RAK0053540
No, they wouldn't let her off that easy.[nl]They wouldn't just expel her,[nl]they'd take her right to the police--
KYK/KYK0000440
....Huh!? T-Tsugumi, what is this!?
SSR/SSR0012890
Oogh! T-That's....
CTG/CTG0013900G
!!
RAK/RAK0053560
Oh no....! She's found them!?
KYK/KYK0000450
Uh, I've more or less picked up on the sort of[nl]relationship you have with Kirisaki....
KYK/KYK0000460
But still, these picture prints have no place[nl]in academics, so don't bring them in the future, okay?
@expose
SSR/SSR0012900
What!? Can't I at least just put them[nl]in my student handbook!?
RAK/RAK0053570
H-Huh? Picture prints don't seem too odd, do they?
CTG/CTG0013910
They don't.[nl]....Except that she's carrying pictures of me around.
SSR/SSR0012910
Mistress, Raku Ichijo. Why is it that you two[nl]have been staring at me for the past few minutes?
RAK/RAK0053580
T-Tsugumi? Wait, are we allowed to get up[nl]and walk around during this?
SSR/SSR0012920
Those who have had their bags inspected[nl]are doing self-study, it seems.
SSR/SSR0012930
But I'm still interested in why you two were[nl]looking at me the whole time.
CTG/CTG0013920
I mean, Tsugumi, given how you are,[nl]we figured you probably had something bad in there.
RAK/RAK0053590
Yeah, we thought it would be chock-full[nl]of guns and grenades.
SSR/SSR0012940
Heh.... You two are so naive.
SSR/SSR0012950
I'm far too well-prepared for this sort of thing. The bag has[nl]a false bottom and fake pockets, and an amateur searcher[nl]doesn't have a prayer of finding them.
RAK/RAK0053600
You modified it!?
SSR/SSR0012960
Of course, there's a whole stash planted in this[nl]very uniform. I'm always ready to take out any[nl]insolent lowlifes who dare to go for you, Mistress!
CTG/CTG0013930
Hahaha.....
RAK/RAK0053610
You're really quite the character.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
SSR/SSR0012970
H-Hmph! Such praise from you[nl]doesn't please me one bit!
RAK/RAK0053620
....No, that wasn't the sort of thing[nl]that should make you feel embarrassed.
