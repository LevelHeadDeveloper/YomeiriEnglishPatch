OTM/OTM0002410
It's been too long since I last spoke[nl]face-to-face with a human.
OTM/OTM0002420
...Well, where should we begin?
OTM/OTM0002430
I know. We can start with your suspicions.
OTM/OTM0002440
What, it's not hard.[nl]Just tap on thy desired option.
@expose
OTM/OTM0002450
Take a good look at me.[nl]What dost thou make of my appearance?

@2shot_otm01_01
OTM/OTM0002460
Well, I don't know what to tell thee.[nl]They're my ears.
OTM/OTM0002470
Of course, they let me hear much better[nl]than human ears like thine would.
OTM/OTM0002480
That's because if I don't listen to thy wishes,[nl]I'd hardly be a goddess.
OTM/OTM0002490
What? Thou thinkest these ears are fake?
@2shot_otm01_02
OTM/OTM0002500
Buuut, I'm the goddess of this shrine![nl]I've been telling thee that since thy arrival!
OTM/OTM0002510
I do not have a "house" per se.[nl]This shrine is where I live.
OTM/OTM0002520
Dost thou have another question?
@2shot_otm01_03
OTM/OTM0002530
Thou art misunderstanding. There is nothing wrong[nl]with a goddess eating an offering at her own shrine, right?
OTM/OTM0002540
Stop complaining or I'll kick you out.
@2shot_otm01_04
OTM/OTM0002550
Mhm. Thou might choose to not[nl]answer like that.
OTM/OTM0002560
That said, silence is considered rude. 
OTM/OTM0002570
I wouldn't recommend it unless thou art[nl]sure it's better not to answer.
OTM/OTM0002580
Don't be shy.[nl]Tell me what thou wish to know.
@2shot_otm01_05
OTM/OTM0002590
We talked about that already, right?
@2shot_otm01_jigen
Ask...
What are those ears?
Please pay for that sushi
Where is your house?
@2shot_otm01_06
OTM/OTM0002600
Ruuude! What a skeptic.
OTM/OTM0002610
There is meaning in everything.[nl]If thou dost not believe it, touch it.
OTM/OTM0002620
Now, touch my ears!
@タッチパート開始処理
@2shot_otm01_07
OTM/OTM0002630
Aaah! E-e-enough! Stop!
OTM/OTM0002640
Fuwaahh...[nl]That tickled......
OTM/OTM0002650
.....but now thou canst tell, right?[nl]These are my real ears.
OTM/OTM0002660
Normally, I would not let anyone touch[nl]my ears so readily...
OTM/OTM0002670
...But I made an exception for thee, because[nl]thou bringeth the best inari sushi I've had in ages!
OTM/OTM0002680
!?!? WHAT?[nl]You made that?!?!
OTM/OTM0002690
What's thy secret!? Please tell me!
OTM/OTM0002700
Hmm... there's a lot of little things, right?
OTM/OTM0002710
If that's the case, just tell me one of them.[nl]Make it the most important one!
@2shot_otm01_08
OTM/OTM0002720
I knew it. [nl]I thought that might have been it.
OTM/OTM0002730
Tofu is the most important part....[nl]what makes inari sushi, "inari sushi".
OTM/OTM0002740
What? "Ukari Tofu" is thy recommended supplier!?
OTM/OTM0002750
This is some great info![nl]I'll have to tell the priest this in a dream.
@2shot_otm01_09
OTM/OTM0002760
Rice... the white spirit of Middle Earth, that is...
OTM/OTM0002770
There's no way one can just forget that. 
OTM/OTM0002780
Huh? For inari sushi, thou recommendeth "Shikari Komachi"?
@2shot_otm01_10
OTM/OTM0002790
As a goddess who values the pure water in this country,[nl]I'm glad thou art sticking to that.
OTM/OTM0002800
Nowadays, people are drinking water that has been[nl]made to taste bad, like tap water...
OTM/OTM0002810
Why? Why? Why not use a well, or drink from a spring,[nl]like before? 
@2shot_otm01_11
OTM/OTM0002820
Umami is the essence of Japanese cuisine.[nl]It is a treasure that even Michelin-star chefs recognize.
OTM/OTM0002830
Thou hast made the dashi from scratch, correct?[nl]Where did thy fish come from?
OTM/OTM0002840
Huh? Thou wert in a hurry, so thou[nl]used instant dashi? "Otoridashi", you said?
OTM/OTM0002850
I see...[nl]Don't do that, 'tis stupid.
@2shot_otm01_12
OTM/OTM0002860
The sweetness and taste are impeccable.[nl]I'm guessing this isn't made with just brown sugar.
OTM/OTM0002870
I see. The high end "Asari Sucrose".
OTM/OTM0002880
Hehehe. I thought so.[nl]It's just as I gathered.
@2shot_otm01_13
OTM/OTM0002890
These days, a lot of amateurs use imitations like[nl]"Mirin-style Seasoning" in their dishes, but...
OTM/OTM0002900
I can tell this is made with real mirin.
OTM/OTM0002910
Not only that, but thou art also particular[nl]about the manufacturers, right?
OTM/OTM0002920
For inari sushi, thou recommendeth... "Masa Nashi Brewery"?!?
@2shot_otm01_14
OTM/OTM0002930
Delicious inari starts with good vinegar and good rice.
OTM/OTM0002940
My grandma said that a lot a long time ago.
OTM/OTM0002950
I see. Thou recommendeth "Dogan Vinegar"?
@2shot_otm01_15
OTM/OTM0002960
Soybeans, wheat, salt...
OTM/OTM0002970
To think, from three such simple ingredients,[nl]we have such a flavorful seasoning...
OTM/OTM0002980
A divine elixir that our country should be proud of.
OTM/OTM0002990
What? Thou recommendeth "Jinwari Soy Sauce"?
@2shot_otm01_16
OTM/OTM0003000
Hmm... I figured that was it.
OTM/OTM0003010
I have no choice but to ask thee to[nl]continue making this for me.
OTM/OTM0003020
When the priest gets back, I'll tell him[nl]to fire the old cook.
OTM/OTM0003030
...in his dreams.
@2shot_otm01_17
OTM/OTM0003040
Hm, thou wouldst withhold[nl]secrets from a goddess...?
@2shot_otm01_18
OTM/OTM0003050
Oh yeah! 
OTM/OTM0003060
I forgot the most important part...[nl]...to tell thee my name!
OTM/OTM0003070
My name is Otama.
OTM/OTM0003080
Go ahead and try it out.[nl]Call out "Otama"!
OTM/OTM0003090
"O", "t", "a", "m", "a". Just 5 letters.[nl]Trace them in order. Easy, right?
OTM/OTM0003100
Instead of just tapping them,[nl]trace over them with one stroke, OK?
OTM/OTM0003110
Come on, call my name.
@2shot_otm01_ana
@2shot_otm01_19
OTM/OTM0003120
Dost thou wish for divine punishment!!?
OTM/OTM0003130
Don't make such silly mistakes![nl]It's "Otama"! "Otama"! 
@2shot_otm01_20
OTM/OTM0003140
Who the hell is that!![nl]It's "Otama"! "Otama"!
OTM/OTM0003150
Calm down, and trace again!
@2shot_otm01_21
OTM/OTM0003160
No. It's "Otama".[nl]Calm down and trace again!
@2shot_otm01_22
OTM/OTM0003170
Didst thou not hear me?[nl]It's "Otama"! "Otama"!
OTM/OTM0003180
Okay. Instead of tapping the letters,[nl]trace over them with thy finger!
@2shot_otm01_23
OTM/OTM0003190
That's right! Otama!
OTM/OTM0003200
It's a very precious name that my grandma gave me.
