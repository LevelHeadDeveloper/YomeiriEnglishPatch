Alright, sweeping's all finished.[nl]Now to wipe down the floor and....
RAK/RAK0069940
Aaaaagh, the floor's all soaked!?[nl]C-Chitoge!? What are you doing!?
@ＢＧＭ再生
CTG/CTG0018180
Um, I'm wiping down the floor?
RAK/RAK0069950
You've got the whole Pacific Ocean on that rag![nl]Wring it out better!
@expose
CTG/CTG0018190
Ugh, jeez, you're so nitpicky about these details.[nl]You need to lighten up or you'll be too stressed all the time.
RAK/RAK0069960
It's hard *not* to be stressed when[nl]the floor's turning into a lake.
CTG/CTG0018200
....What.....ever.....
RAK/RAK0069970
Huh?
CTG/CTG0018210
I'm saying I don't know how to wring out a rag....
RAK/RAK0069980
Huh, really!? Are you joking!?
CTG/CTG0018220
I-I can't help it![nl]Back in school in America, we didn't have to clean,[nl]and at home the guys do everything....
RAK/RAK0069990
(Hasn't she even cleaned anything in her room....[nl] Wait, let's not jab at her....)
Provoke her into doing it
Teach her how
RAK/RAK0070000
Hey, hey, Chitoge. Over here, wringing out a rag[nl]is something even an elementary schooler can do.[nl]Do you think this might be a biiiit of a you problem?
CTG/CTG0018230
Shut up! All I gotta do is squeeze it!
CTG/CTG0018240
Nggggghhh....[nl]Here, how's that?
RAK/RAK0070010
Now you're just squishing it.[nl]You should do more of a combined twist and squeeze.
CTG/CTG0018250
....L-Like this?
RAK/RAK0070020
Right. Perfect.
CTG/CTG0018260
I see. So I should have done it like *this*.
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0070030
Owwwww![nl]S-Stop wringing my arm!
CTG/CTG0018270
Hmph. That's what you get for comparing me[nl]to an elementary schooler.
RAK/RAK0070040
(You went for the "rag squeeze"....[nl] You really do have the mind of an elementary schooler.)
RAK/RAK0070050
Keep your arms at your sides, and use them to squeeze,[nl]not just your hands....
CTG/CTG0018280
L-Like this....?
RAK/RAK0070060
Not at all! Why are you squeezing it, wring it!
CTG/CTG0018290
T-That's what I'm doing! How is that any different!?
RAK/RAK0070070
Man, you're hopeless![nl]Stay put for a sec.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0018300
Huh? W-Wait a second!
@背景変更
CTG/CTG0018310
W-What are you doing!? You idiot!
RAK/RAK0070080
Don't move![nl]I won't be able to show you how to wring this out!
CTG/CTG0018320
Y-You can just use your words and tell me how![nl]Why do you need to go behind me!?
RAK/RAK0070090
Because I tried telling you and it didn't work![nl]Here, shut up and hold the rag.
CTG/CTG0018330
Ghh...![nl]F-Fine....
RAK/RAK0070100
Alright. You hold it like this, then wring it like this.....
CTG/CTG0018340
Oh, amazing....[nl]It's working....
RAK/RAK0070110
You don't need to put in quite so much effort.[nl]Just remember how this feels, and try doing it yourself, okay?
CTG/CTG0018350
O-Okay.
CTG/CTG0018360
....Ngggggh....
RAK/RAK0070120
Oh, looks like you've got it.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0018370
I really didn't need a ton of power.
RAK/RAK0070130
Pretty easy once you know how, right?
RAK/RAK0070140
Alright, you start wiping from that end,[nl]and I'll start from the other end.
CTG/CTG0018380
O.K.!
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0018390
...Alright! We're done![nl]Amazing! It's so clean!
RAK/RAK0070150
Nice, isn't it?[nl]You should also clean your own room occasionally, okay?
CTG/CTG0018400
....I-I do that. Rude.
