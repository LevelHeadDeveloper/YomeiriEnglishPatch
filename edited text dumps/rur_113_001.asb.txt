Lately, I've been hearing a lot of talk about our school's[nl]Seven Wonders. How much of that do you think is true?
RAK/RAK0043020
I don't think any of it's true.[nl]If ghosts and monsters and stuff were real, wouldn't the[nl]whole world be full of the occult?
RUR/RUR0009320
Yeah. I think ghosts and monsters are just figments[nl]of our imaginations. I've never seen one myself.
SYU/SYU0007620
But have you heard the phrase "no smoke without fire"?
RUR/RUR0009330
Are you familiar with the phrase[nl]"create a problem, sell a solution"?
SYU/SYU0007630
Hey, I didn't do anything.
@expose
RUR/RUR0009340
That a fact....?
KSK/KSK0010580
But there really have been a lot of rumors floating around.[nl]People are talking about hearing noises or laughter from[nl]empty classrooms after school gets out.
RUR/RUR0009350
Just their imaginations.[nl]Nothing to be afraid of.
KSK/KSK0010590
Just their imaginations....[nl]T-That has to be it.... Yeah.
SYU/SYU0007640
But what if the rumors turn out to be true!?[nl]You could be cursed by a GHOST!
RUR/RUR0009360
There's no such thing, I'm telling you.
SYU/SYU0007650
How can you be sure?
RUR/RUR0009370
Then let me ask you the opposite question:[nl]Why is it that everything we know about them is hearsay, but there[nl]aren't any concrete stories from people who have genuinely had an encounter?
RUR/RUR0009380
Have any of you guys ever actually run into one?[nl]A real ghost or monster?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0007660
No, I haven't.[nl]Raku?
RAK/RAK0043030
Well, I....
It's not like I haven't
....I haven't
RAK/RAK0043040
It's not as though I've never seen any....
RAK/RAK0043050
(Otama being a perfect example.)
KSK/KSK0010600
Whaa!? Really!?
SYU/SYU0007670
Hang on, Raku![nl]Why hadn't you told us such an interesting story!?
RUR/RUR0009390
What happened, exactly?
RAK/RAK0043060
Uhhh, wellll, it's not as though anything[nl]specific happened, okay? W-Well, nothing really worth[nl]talking about, anyway!
SYU/SYU0007680
....Hmmm. Sounds kinda fishy to me.
KSK/KSK0010610
B-But, if Ichijo doesn't want to talk about it,[nl]we shouldn't force him to, right?
RUR/RUR0009400
Well, if you say so, Kosaki.
RAK/RAK0043070
(Phew. I didn't spill the beans....)
RAK/RAK0043080
(I can't tell them about Otama.)
RAK/RAK0043090
I haven't.[nl]....How about you, Onodera?
KSK/KSK0010620
I-I haven't as of now....I guess.
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0009410
See? A school in and of itself can seem kind of creepy[nl]depending on how you're feeling in the moment, right?[nl]The Seven Wonders are just a product of that fear.
SYU/SYU0007690
Using such theories to protect ourselves, are we, Ruri?[nl]Are you sure you're not scaaaared?
RUR/RUR0009420
Absolutely positive.
SYU/SYU0007700
But, you know....[nl]They say that when you tell scary stories, ghosts show up.
KSK/KSK0010630
Waaaaaaaagh!
RAK/RAK0043100
C-Calm down, Onodera![nl]That was just the poster behind you falling down!
KSK/KSK0010640
Oh, I-I see.[nl]It was just a poster....
RUR/RUR0009430
Yes, yes. Don't be scared.
SYU/SYU0007710
You really don't seem scared at all, Ruri.
RUR/RUR0009440
Like I said, I'm not scared.
RAK/RAK0043110
!!
RAK/RAK0043120
(Ohh, I see. Miyamoto was just insisting that there[nl] weren't any ghosts because Onodera was scared.)
