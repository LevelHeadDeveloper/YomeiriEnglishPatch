But how can you be sure[nl]he has two cameras?
RUR/RUR0004590
Do you have any proof?[nl]Like, did you ever see him with two cameras?
Any proof?
The day I broke into[nl]Chitoge's house....
That day at the pool....
RUR/RUR0004600
What are you talking about?[nl]You didn't have a camera that day.
RUR/RUR0004610
And it's not like Maiko was even there....
RUR/RUR0004620
You can't just cover it up[nl]by saying random things.

That day at the pool, you each had a camera[nl]so youcould split up and take pictures!?
RUR/RUR0004640
I see....[nl]So then he definitely had two cameras....
RUR/RUR0004650
If he deliberately let one of them get destroyed[nl]so he could catch me off guard....
RUR/RUR0004660
....that's quite the plan.[nl]I hate myself for being so easily fooled.
RUR/RUR0004670
Anyway, that seems like a reasonable explanation[nl]for the coffee shop photo.

No evidence, just a random statement?
RUR/RUR0004690
I seriously doubt it.[nl]You're complicit after all, aren't you?
