Raku dearessst![nl]We've been having a lot of chilly days lately.
RAK/RAK0077170
Yeah. The kind with higher temperatures in the west[nl]and lower in the east....right?[nl]I can't stand the cold, but I'm glad we've got a lot of sunny days.
......
RAK/RAK0077180
....?
MRK/MRK0014010
But we also need to worry about getting too dry.[nl]Not just our skin, but our eyes can dry out too....
RAK/RAK0077190
Y-Yeah.... That's right.
RAK/RAK0077200
(W-What the hell....? This conversation's so frivolous....?[nl] Talking about dry weather like this just isn't like her....)
RAK/RAK0077210
(Hmm!? ....Wait a sec.)

RAK/RAK0077220
Hey, Tachibana....[nl]Your eyes....
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0014020
Yes! I didn't think you'd notice!!
RAK/RAK0077230
Well, since you were emphasizing your eyes so much....[nl]You're wearing colored contacts?
RAK/RAK0077240
(Is it something around here....?)
RAK/RAK0077250
....No, I don't see anything unusual there...
MRK/MRK0014030
Jeez, Raku dearest.[nl]You're so dense....
RAK/RAK0077260
Huh?
MRK/MRK0014040
I can't help but feel bad for Kirisaki's struggles now....
MRK/MRK0014050
It's here, right here.[nl]The color of my eyes!
RAK/RAK0077270
....Oh, it is! They're different!
RAK/RAK0077280
So you're wearing colored contacts?
MRK/MRK0014060
Yes. I thought I'd change my image a little[nl]and make them the same color as Kirisaki's eyes.
MRK/MRK0014070
I was curious whether or not you'd like it, Raku dearest.[nl]What do you think?
RAK/RAK0077290
I think....
The old ones are better
These ones are better
You're cute either way
RAK/RAK0077300
There's really no need to force yourself to match Chitoge.[nl]Your natural look is best.
MRK/MRK0014080
I see. Since you're dating Kirisaki, I thought for sure[nl]you'd prefer this eye color....
MRK/MRK0014090
But if that's not the case, I'll take these out posthaste.
RAK/RAK0077310
I like these, they're very novel.[nl]I think they look very exotic.
MRK/MRK0014100
I see....![nl]So the reason you didn't like me back before[nl]was because my eyes were the wrong color!
RAK/RAK0077320
No, that has nothing to do with....
MRK/MRK0014110
Come now! There's no need to be shy about it.
MRK/MRK0014120
The reason you put up with Kirisaki's violence against you[nl]is because you have a soft spot for blue eyes, isn't it?
MRK/MRK0014130
Or, maybe you're okay with any girl,[nl]as long as she has blue eyes!?
RAK/RAK0077330
Stop talking about people like they're perverts!
MRK/MRK0014140
Am I wrong?
RAK/RAK0077340
Very wrong. I don't have a blue-eye fetish,[nl]and I don't change my opinion of people based on the color[nl]of their eyes.
MRK/MRK0014150
I see.[nl]....Well then, I guess these contacts are useless.[nl]I will take them out posthaste.
MRK/MRK0014160
Oh, but if you want to see me wearing them again,[nl]let me know, okay? I'd be happy to do anything[nl]for you after all, Raku dearest!
RAK/RAK0077350
(I wonder if she'll try to dye her hair blonde next.[nl] She doesn't need to change herself so drastically....)
RAK/RAK0077360
Makes no difference one way or another.[nl]Whatever color your eyes are, Tachibana, you're you,[nl]and you're cute either way.
MRK/MRK0014170
Fwaah!?!?
@ザクシャ万里花・中
MRK/MRK0014180
N-N-N-No fair....[nl]Callin' me cute....to my face like that....[nl]Umm.... Now I'm all embarrassed....
RAK/RAK0077370
Don't be embarrassed.[nl]You really are cute, Tachibana....
RAK/RAK0077380
Actually, don't you think there's no need to change[nl]the color of your eyes? Your natural look is best.
MRK/MRK0014190
Very well....[nl]If you say so, Raku dearest, I shall take these out.
MRK/MRK0014200
Hahh..... Cute.... Cute....[nl]I'm so happyyyy....
MRK/MRK0014210
Fwaaahhh....
RAK/RAK0077390
(Getting as happy as she did....[nl] Did I say something wrong?)
