Cleaning up the shed took long enough for[nl]it to get pretty late already.[nl]Kyoko-chan really works us like slaves, sheesh.
CTG/CTG0001190
Lately, it's been getting dark earlier as well.[nl]I'm also not really a fan of dark places, too......
RAK/RAK0000690
Now that you mention it, you're surprisingly easily spooked.[nl]You were pretty shaken by the test of courage.
KSK/KSK0000250
Huh? Chitoge-chan, are you by chance scared of ghosts?
@expose
CTG/CTG0001200
Ah, no, I'm more scared of the dark. If we're talking[nl]ghosts themselves, I'm alright.
CTG/CTG0001210
If anything, I actually like paranormal activity and stuff.
RUR/RUR0000010
Ah, in that case, I have a juicy story[nl]to tell you, Chitoge-chan.
CTG/CTG0001220
.....Huh?
RUR/RUR0000020
Yeah. Behind the neighborhood shrine, there's that[nl]old decrepit Shinto gate, right?
RUR/RUR0000030
From there..... It comes. The ghost.
KSK/KSK0000260
Ah, I've heard that before.[nl]Isn't it supposed to look like a young girl with a tail?
RAK/RAK0000700
(Huh? Don't tell me......)
RUR/RUR0000040
Yes. If you ask her for a wish, she'll[nl]grant any of your desires, according to the rumors.
CTG/CTG0001230
Heh, really!? A ghost that'll grant any wish[nl]sounds like something out of a fairy tale.
KSK/KSK0000270
I might go to try it out! Maybe I'll wish to[nl]become good at cooking, or something.
CTG/CTG0001240
Ah, in that case, Kosaki-chan,[nl]why don't we go together sometime?[nl]I think it'll be interesting.
RAK/RAK0000710
O-oi, hold up a sec! Stop that thought there![nl]It's probably fake anyways, fake news!
CTG/CTG0001250
Heh~, really?
RAK/RAK0000720
Yes, really!
RAK/RAK0000730
(That fox is seriously nothing but trouble......[nl]I can't let them get wrapped up in her antics.)
RAK/RAK0000740
Those types of stories always end up being marketing ploys[nl]to get people to come and cough up money.
CTG/CTG0001260
Mugh. Read the room, bean sprout.
RUR/RUR0000050
I see.[nl]So Ichijou-kun isn't really interested in this kind of thing.
RUR/RUR0000060
Alright, have you heard this, though?[nl]The one where "Every night, mysterious sounds and[nl]wails are heard from the empty classroom."
KSK/KSK0000280
W-what is that? I've never heard that one.
RAK/RAK0000750
Yeah, me neither.
RUR/RUR0000070
This is a really recent story.[nl]According to a girl from one class over,[nl]she once stayed late on the grounds after club......
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
@ＢＧＭ再生
RUR/RUR0000080
And from somewhere, they heard something pop,[nl]followed by a man crying out in pain......
CTG/CTG0001270
A, ahaha....... Every school has stuff like that,[nl]those kinds of ghost stories.
RUR/RUR0000090
The sound seemed to be coming from the direction[nl]of one of the third-year classrooms.
RUR/RUR0000100
Understandably worried, she climbed the stairs and started[nl]towards that classroom, alone.....
KSK/KSK0000290
S-she sure is brave. I definitely couldn't have gone.......
RUR/RUR0000110
And then, what do you think she saw?
RUR/RUR0000120
Right before her eyes, the scene that greeted her......
@ＢＧＭ停止
RUR/RUR0000130
Was a classroom completely soaked[nl]from corner to corner with blood......!
@叫び揺れ
CTG/CTG0001280
Gyahhhhhh!?
RUR/RUR0000140
The blackboard, the podium, the desks,[nl]everything was completely covered in fresh blood.[nl]As if someone had been killed there just earlier.
RAK/RAK0000760
Seriously.......[nl]So then, what did she do next?
RUR/RUR0000150
She lost consciousness, and apparently[nl]can't recall anything afterwards. However......
RAK/RAK0000770
However?
RUR/RUR0000160
When she woke up, she was at the entrance of the school.
RUR/RUR0000170
She should have fainted right there in the classroom,[nl]and yet she came to, she was out front with her back[nl]against the gate.
KSK/KSK0000300
S-so what happened......?
CTG/CTG0001290
Don't tell me....[nl]the ghost found her and took her outside.....?
RUR/RUR0000180
Seems to be the conclusion a lot of people are drawing.
RUR/RUR0000190
She tried to look for signs[nl]of the event after it had gotten bright[nl]again, but to no avail.
CTG/CTG0001300
We-well then she saw a dream or was hallucinating!? Surely!
RUR/RUR0000200
....that's one possibility.[nl]Whether that be true or false, no one knows.
RUR/RUR0000210
So why don't we head in tonight and try to prove it?
KSK/KSK0000310
Th-that's a joke, right!? I'm not doing that!
RUR/RUR0000220
Heh, I'm joking, of course.[nl]At this chilly time of year, I'm not gonna actually[nl]suggest going to the school at night.
RAK/RAK0000780
Hm?
CTG/CTG0001310
Ah, ahaha....... I might've got[nl]a little hungry from the shock.[nl]Anyone want to join me somewhere?
RAK/RAK0000790
What even is that......[nl]Don't blame your animal-like appetite on the ghost stories.
KSK/KSK0000320
Ah, but I think I'd like to join.[nl]It'd be nice to get my mind off of ghosts.
RUR/RUR0000230
I'll come too. Let's get some sweets or something[nl]from that cafe over there.
@時間経過演出
RUR/RUR0000240
Phew, I'm stuffed. That was good.
KSK/KSK0000330
As always, that was an impressive helping[nl]that you flattened, Ruri-chan.
RUR/RUR0000250
Today's classical lit homework looked[nl]massive as well, didn't it?[nl]You can't fight on an empty stomach, as they say.
KSK/KSK0000340
Ah. That's right, we had to do that.[nl]I'm going to have to get home quick and finish it.
KSK/KSK0000350
......Well then, Ichijou-kun, Ruri-chan and I are this way.[nl]See you later.
RAK/RAK0000800
Alright. Take care, then.
CTG/CTG0001320
See you tomorrow!
CTG/CTG0001330
Huh......? It's not here.....?
RAK/RAK0000810
Hm? What are you looking for?
CTG/CTG0001340
I can't find my classical lit notebook.
CTG/CTG0001350
Awesome.......[nl]I might have left it in the classroom.
CTG/CTG0001360
Uwah..... what am I gonna do?[nl]With that amount, there's no way[nl]I could cram it in tomorrow.....
RAK/RAK0000820
How are you forgetting something so important like that?
CTG/CTG0001370
Shut it! You didn't seem so calm when you lost your precious[nl]pendant just a little while back!
RAK/RAK0000830
Ugh!
CTG/CTG0001380
In any case, we've got to go back to school.
CTG/CTG0001390
Come on, Raku! Let's go!
RAK/RAK0000840
Haah? Why do I have to?
CTG/CTG0001400
I-it just can't be helped! I'm not good with dark[nl]places to begin with, and on top of that we just[nl]were talking about ghosts and stuff......
RAK/RAK0000850
So basically, you're scared to go back by yourself?
CTG/CTG0001410
Y-yes, exactly! It's scary. You have a problem with that!?
RAK/RAK0000860
(Good grief......)
Guess I'll tag along
Annoying....
RAK/RAK0000870
Well, I can't be leaving a girl to roam around[nl]the school alone at night.[nl]Guess I'll tag along.
RAK/RAK0000880
Setting ghosts aside, it'd be bad if you ran into[nl]any sex offenders or anything like that.
CTG/CTG0001420
Does that mean you'd protect me if I was attacked?
RAK/RAK0000890
Well after all, I am said to be your boyfriend,[nl]so I'll do what I can.
CTG/CTG0001430
H-hmmm.[nl]Well, I won't expect anything much,[nl]but I'll thank you for the thought.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
RAK/RAK0000900
(In reality, I'd almost be scared for[nl]the sex offenders if that happened....)
RAK/RAK0000910
Why do I have to baby you for every little thing?[nl]Frankly, I can't be bothered.
CTG/CTG0001440
Uwah !? You actually said that!?[nl]I helped you find your pendant, didn't I?[nl]Are you forgetting that you owe me!?
RAK/RAK0000920
No, that's not what I was talking about.....
CTG/CTG0001450
Mugh......![nl]If you do this, I'm going to tell everyone you're a cold,[nl]unfeeling jerk boyfriend who left me to the wolves!
CTG/CTG0001460
And if you start getting the cold shoulder from Kosaki-chan[nl]and the others, I won't help you!
CTG/CTG0001470
And then you'll spend the rest of your[nl]high school life with that reputation!
RAK/RAK0000930
(Looks like she's gone straight to blackmail......)
RAK/RAK0000940
Alright, alright! I'll help you.[nl]Looks like I don't have much say anyways.
CTG/CTG0001480
Hmph. Should've just said that from the beginning!
RAK/RAK0000950
By the way, I don't mind sticking around.......[nl]but why not Tsugumi or Four-eyes?
CTG/CTG0001490
About that, Tsugumi and Claude both[nl]are apparently swamped.
CTG/CTG0001500
Every once in a while, there are days like this where[nl]I don't have any bodyguards.
RAK/RAK0000960
Hmmm. I guess even with them,[nl]there's sometimes important work[nl]they have to prioritize even over you.
CTG/CTG0001510
Yeah. I wonder what it is.
CTG/CTG0001520
Surely they aren't making a plan on sending you[nl]to the afterlife around now......
RAK/RAK0000970
Y-you idiot! Don't say scary stuff like that!
CTG/CTG0001530
Fufu, that's what you get for calling me a scaredy cat![nl]Alrighty, let's head out already!
CTG/CTG0001540
Ugh..... With that said, scary stuff is still scary......
RAK/RAK0000980
O-oi, Chitoge. Don't cling to me so much,[nl]you're making it hard to walk.
CTG/CTG0001550
It can't be helped![nl]I'm not good with this kind of situation.
CTG/CTG0001560
Uhhh........
RAK/RAK0000990
Come on, get up off the floor.
CTG/CTG0001570
B-but......
RAK/RAK0001000
-tch, you're a lost cause.
CTG/CTG0001580
......huh?
CTG/CTG0001590
Uwah, wawawa!? Hey wai- wha, what are you doing!?
RAK/RAK0001010
If you can't move yourself,[nl]I'm gonna have to move you, right?
CTG/CTG0001600
W-w-what!? But this is embarassing, all of a sudden!
RAK/RAK0001020
O-oi, quit squirming so much![nl]I mean, it isn't embarrassing just for you, y'know!
CTG/CTG0001610
I mean in the first place, doing this,[nl]don't you first set up more of a romantic setting first!?
CTG/CTG0001620
Just picking me up like this with no mood, no preparation,[nl]in this damn school, you really don't know even the basics[nl]of a woman's heart, you moron!
RAK/RAK0001030
Yeah, yeah, I got it, just calm down.[nl]If you keep moving around like that you could get hurt.
CTG/CTG0001630
O-okay.[nl]Just whatever you do, don't drop me.
CTG/CTG0001640
Jeez, if you were going to do this, let me at least[nl]mentally prepare a little first.[nl]Seriously......
RAK/RAK0001040
You say something?
CTG/CTG0001650
It's nothing!!
RAK/RAK0001050
That so.....?
@背景変更
.............
RAK/RAK0001060
Hey, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0001660
W-what.
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0001070
Don't you feel like you can[nl]hear a voice coming from somewhere?
CTG/CTG0001670
Huh? S-stop it with that.
RAK/RAK0001080
No seriously, listen close for a sec.
CTG/CTG0001680
――――!
@ＢＧＭ再生
CTG/CTG0001690
I-isn't this what Ruri-chan was just talking about......?
RAK/RAK0001090
Mysterious sounds and screams. Checks out.[nl]Seems like that rumor was really true after all.
CTG/CTG0001700
Huh? Th-then, that blood-stained classroom,[nl]and the ghost, too....!?
RAK/RAK0001100
Just......maybe.
RAK/RAK0001110
In the worst case, it's possible we could be caught[nl]and carried out just like the girl in the rumor.....
CTG/CTG0001710
N-noooo!!
@ＨＰ－１０
RAK/RAK0001120
Aghhh!!? C-chitoge!?[nl]Quit grabbing me so tight all of a sudden!
CTG/CTG0001720
I-it's cause you're saying all this scary stuff in the first place!
RAK/RAK0001130
I-I'm going to put you down, okay!?
CTG/CTG0001730
I-I just can't anymore......![nl]Do something, Raku......!
RAK/RAK0001140
(Chitoge's totally gone at this point.......[nl]I've got to do something to calm her down)
