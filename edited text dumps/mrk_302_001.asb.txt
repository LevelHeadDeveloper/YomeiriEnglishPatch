CPA/CPA0000060
Come on, come onnn![nl]We're just wanna go somewhere fun with you.
CPB/CPB0000100
After all, how could we leave a hottie like you alone?
MRK/MRK0017840
....Hahh, this is a real pain.
RAK/RAK0080890
(So it *is* Tachibana.[nl] Looks like she's getting harrassed by some weirdos,[nl] what should I do?)
Help her right away.
Honda will help her.
RAK/RAK0080900
(Wait, I don't need to think about this!)
RAK/RAK0080910
H-Heeey, Marika![nl]Whatcha doin' in a place like this?
CPA/CPA0000070
Huh?
@expose

RAK/RAK0080920
I thought I told you not to wander off[nl]Come on, let's go.
RAK/RAK0080930
Ohhh, sorry, fellas.[nl]Seems like she was causing trouble.
RAK/RAK0080940
Welp, goodbye!

@ザクシャ万里花・小
RAK/RAK0080950
Aaagh! You idiot![nl]This isn't the part where you should say anything!
MRK/MRK0017880
If you want, we can start being real lovers now, okay?[nl]I'm ready to warm up anytime!
RAK/RAK0080960
Don't you know what's going on!?
CPA/CPA0000080
What the hell....have you been lying to us?
CPB/CPB0000110
Using those dirty tricks....
MRK/MRK0017890
I assure you, there's no lying here![nl]Raku dearest and I are going to be true lovers from now on!
RAK/RAK0080970
Hahhhh, jeeeez....
CPA/CPA0000090
I dunno about you, but I don't think a cute girl[nl]like you and your scrawny pudding boy here are a good match.
CPB/CPB0000120
Wouldn't you be better off with a studly-type[nl]guy like us?
MRK/MRK0017900
Raku dearest and you are as different[nl]as the sun and a water flea. Please be a little more understanding.
CPA/CPA0000100
Whaaat!?
RAK/RAK0080980
Waagh! Why are you egging them on!?
MRK/MRK0017910
Because these people are making fun of you, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0080990
I went to all the trouble of trying to help you[nl]and now you're making things complicated!
MRK/MRK0017920
It's my mission to put my darling Raku first.
RAK/RAK0081000
H-Hey! Don't throw yourself into my arms!
CPA/CPA0000110
Oy! What're you two making out for!?
CPB/CPB0000130
You gotta be kiddin' me....[nl]I'm gonna have to punch you in the face!
RAK/RAK0081010
Aaaah! Wait, wait![nl]Violence isn't the answer!
CPA/CPA0000120
Shut up! Eat this!

HND/HND0000870

CPB/CPB0000140
Huh?
HND/HND0000880
Everyone, if you please.
PLA/PLA0000020

CPB/CPB0000150
Aaaaaaagh! H-H-Help meeee!
RAK/RAK0081030
(Amazing. They got rid of them in no time flat....)
HND/HND0000890
Forgive me for intervening, Mistress.[nl]Are you hurt?
@expose
MRK/MRK0017930
Not at all.
HND/HND0000900
Master Ichijo, thank you for helping her out of danger.
RAK/RAK0081040
N-No, it was nothing.[nl]I wasn't much help....
MRK/MRK0017940
Hey, listen to this, Honda![nl]A few minutes ago, Raku dearest called me Marika!
MRK/MRK0017950
What's more, he appeared out of thin air[nl]and tried to save me.
MRK/MRK0017960
He was just like a knight in shining armor,[nl]I was so excited!
RAK/RAK0081050
That's what got me into this mess....[nl]You know what I mean, right?
MRK/MRK0017970
Yes![nl]If it means you'll save me again, I'll get harrassed as much as I need to. ♪
MRK/MRK0017980
So, please call me Marika again.[nl]Next time, I'll act like your girlfriend and keep quiet!
RAK/RAK0081060
You don't know what I mean at all!
RAK/RAK0081070
Jeez.... Honda ended up taking care of it,[nl]so I guess there was no need to intervene.
MRK/MRK0017990
That's not true at all, Raku dearest.[nl]You've made me very happy.
@ザクシャ万里花・中
MRK/MRK0018000
Even now, I can't stop my heart from pounding.[nl]Thank you so much, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0081080
(Well, whatever. Honda's probably nearby, anyway.)
CPA/CPA0000140
Heeey, come on.[nl]Don't you wanna have a little fun with us?
CPB/CPB0000160
I'll bet you're just here by yourself, aren't you?
MRK/MRK0018010
....Aaagh, jeez![nl]You guys are obnoxious.
MRK/MRK0018020
Hondaaa!
HND/HND0000910
....As you wish.
RAK/RAK0081090
(She is the daughter of the chief of police, after all....[nl] That's a hell of a high level of alert.)
