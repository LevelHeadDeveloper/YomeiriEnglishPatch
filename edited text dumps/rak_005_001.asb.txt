Alriiiight, I'm done with my homework![nl]Every single answer's been filled in!
KSK/KSK0009210
Good work, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0007750
Oh, you're done too, Kosaki?
@expose
KSK/KSK0009220
Yep. I finished quickly because Chitoge helped me with[nl]the parts I didn't understand.
SSR/SSR0010780
As per usual, Mistress,[nl]you're the best teacher.
MRK/MRK0009730
Raku deareesssst![nl]I don't understand any of these problems!
CTG/CTG0011170
Hang on, Marika! I just showed you[nl]how to do these a minute or so ago!
MRK/MRK0009740
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I have a bad case of[nl]"Can't-understand-it-unless-Raku-dearest-explains-it-to-me-itis"....
CTG/CTG0011180
There's no such verbose illness![nl]Stop complaining and concentrate on your work!
MRK/MRK0009750
Oh, I do apologize. But, Kirisaki, aren't you the one[nl]who's letting that fashion magazine distract you[nl]from *your* work?
CTG/CTG0011190
Whatever, *I* finished all my work already.[nl]Actually, *you're* the one who brought this magazine in the first place!
KSK/KSK0009230
Ooh, this outfit is so cute!
RUR/RUR0007760
It is. I think it'd look good on you.
CTG/CTG0011200
Right!? That frilliness is *choice*![nl]Whaddya think, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0010790
I can't say I'm too knowledgable about stuff like this....[nl]But, yes. I think it's very nice.
CTG/CTG0011210
Hey, check this out, bean sprout![nl]Don't you also think this outfit is cute?
RAK/RAK0039140
Well, I can't really say....[nl]I don't know much about clothing.
CTG/CTG0011220
Huuuhh? You really can't even tell[nl]whether clothes are cute or not!?
RAK/RAK0039150
N-No....does it matter?
RUR/RUR0007770
You really are stupid.[nl]When it comes to things like these, I want people[nl]to say I look cute.
RAK/RAK0039160
Huh? Is that how it is?[nl]I had no idea.
RUR/RUR0007780
If that's really the case, then you could stand[nl]to learn a lot more about how women's hearts work, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0039170
Hmmmmmm....[nl]W-Women's hearts?
CTG/CTG0011230
You tell him, Ruri![nl]Honestly, Raku, you just don't understand women's hearts at all.
RAK/RAK0039180
T-That's not true at all![nl]Right....Onodera?
.......
RAK/RAK0039190
Onodera!?
RUR/RUR0007790
You just don't get it, do you.
SSR/SSR0010800
Yeah, he doesn't.
MRK/MRK0009760
You don't need to worry about that at all, though![nl]Even if you don't understand women's hearts in the slightest,[nl]I still think my darling Raku is wonderful!
RAK/RAK0039200
Nghhh....I see.[nl]So *all* of you think that, huh.
RAK/RAK0039210
Specifically, what is it about women's hearts[nl]I don't understand?
CTG/CTG0011240
L-Let's see.... For example, when I get quiet[nl]and you just automatically assume it's because I'm hungry.
RAK/RAK0039220
Huh? Was I wrong any of those times!
CTG/CTG0011250
Hey, rude! In those types of situations,[nl]I want you to understand what's bothering me without[nl]me telling you.... Jeez.
RAK/RAK0039230
But I can't know what's bothering you unless you tell me!
CTG/CTG0011260
I get quiet specifically because I don't want to tell you![nl]Gawd, this is the sort of thing that men just don't[nl]get about women, I'm telling you!!
RAK/RAK0039240
Ghhh....!

RAK/RAK0039250
Hahh.... Good grief, that Chitoge's[nl]always going off about something.
OTM/OTM0004120
Hey, Raku![nl]Thy friends have gone home already?
RAK/RAK0039260
No, not yet.[nl]Sorry for kicking you outta the room.
OTM/OTM0004130
I don't really careth. However, 'tis nice[nl]to see you having fun.
RAK/RAK0039270
Well....I wouldn't say 'fun', so much as 'a hard time'....
OTM/OTM0004140
A hard time? With what?
RAK/RAK0039280
They all say I don't understand women's hearts,[nl]so they got all riled up....
RAK/RAK0039290
I've been accused of not studying that area enough.
OTM/OTM0004150
Oh.
RAK/RAK0039300
But why should I study women's hearts, anyway?[nl]I'm not even a woman to begin with, so it's[nl]not really possible for me to understand them, anyway.
OTM/OTM0004160
....Mhm, mhm. I see, I see.
RAK/RAK0039310
You get what I'm saying, Otama?
OTM/OTM0004170
Mhm. May I haveth some tea cakes as well?
RAK/RAK0039320
....You weren't listening at all, were you....?
RAK/RAK0039330
Everyone, I brought some drinks!
CTG/CTG0011270
Thanks, Raku....
@ＢＧＭ停止
CTG/CTG0011280
Huh?
KSK/KSK0009240G
Huh?
RAK/RAK0039340
What, why are you all looking so surprised....?[nl]Something the matter?
SSR/SSR0010820
Who are you?
RAK/RAK0039350
Who are....huh?[nl]Is this a joke?
KSK/KSK0009250
Ummm.... Do you live here?
MRK/MRK0009780
D-Don't tell me you live here, with my darling Raku!?
RAK/RAK0039360
....Huh?[nl]N-No.... I don't know what you're trying to say....
RAK/RAK0039370
(Huh? Whose reflection is that, in the mirror....?)
CTG/CTG0011290
W-What are you doing?[nl]You're touching yourself all over.
RAK/RAK0039380
(And this unfamiliar chest....[nl] I-Is this a girl's....)
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0039390
GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH![nl]WHAT IS THIIISSSSSSS!?
CTG/CTG0011300
Hey, y-y-y-you![nl]What's the matter!?
SSR/SSR0010830
Are you okay? You seem to be profusely sweating.....
RAK/RAK0039400
Aaah!? Y-Y-Yeah! I-I-I'm fine![nl]This must be a dream.....uh....or not, I'm not sure!
KSK/KSK0009260
You look like you're about to cry....[nl]Are you really okay?
RAK/RAK0039410
Yeah, I was just peeling some onions a while ago![nl]Hahaha....
RUR/RUR0007810
So, who are you, again?
RAK/RAK0039420
Uh....ummmm....[nl]W-Who am I, you ask....
KSK/KSK0009270
You look a lot like Ichijo.[nl]Are you a cousin of his?
RAK/RAK0039430
....Oh, yes! Of course!
RAK/RAK0039440
I'm a distant relative of Raku Ichijo....[nl]Umm....you can call me "Rakuko"!
CTG/CTG0011310
Oh, I see. I get it now![nl]Ohh, so your name also starts with "Raku".
RAK/RAK0039450
A-Ahahaha. That's right.[nl]Seems we just have very similar names....
RUR/RUR0007820
So, where'd Ichijo go?
RAK/RAK0039460
W-Well.... His father called him away for something![nl]It seems to have been something very urgent!
CTG/CTG0011320
Is that why Raku sent you to us with this tea?[nl]Sorry he made you bring it all the way here.
RAK/RAK0039470
N-No, no....[nl]No trouble at all. Hohoho....
MRK/MRK0009790
But why are you wearing exactly the same clothing[nl]as Raku dearest?
RAK/RAK0039480
Whaaaa!?[nl]N-Noo.... This is a completely different outfit!
MRK/MRK0009800
Is that a fact....?
CTG/CTG0011330
But I agree. I do think you'd look way better[nl]in something cuter....
CTG/CTG0011340
Oh, of course! I just had a great idea.[nl]Hey, why not come shopping with all of us?
RAK/RAK0039490
....Huh!?
SSR/SSR0010840
Sounds like a good idea.[nl]I'll be there too, of course.
MRK/MRK0009810
I'll come too. Since Raku dearest's relatives will be[nl]my relatives in the future, I need to do what I can now[nl]to deepen my relationship with them.
KSK/KSK0009280
Okay, I'll come too. How about you, Ruri?
RUR/RUR0007830
Whatever, I don't mind.
CTG/CTG0011350
Then it's settled! Where should we go shopping?
CTG/CTG0011360
....Um, do you mind if I call you 'Rakuko-chan'?
RAK/RAK0039500
H-Hahh.... Sure.
CTG/CTG0011370
You can call me Chitoge. So, Rakuko-chan,[nl]you have any favorite clothing brands?
RAK/RAK0039510
C-Clothing brands!? No, I don't have any particilar preference....
CTG/CTG0011380
Really? Well, I think this outfit here in this magazine would[nl]look great on you. Shall we go to the flagship outlet[nl]for this brand?
RAK/RAK0039520
F-Flagship outl--? Do they sell flags....?
RAK/RAK0039530
Uh....I guess you know best, Chitoge.[nl]H-Hehehe....
CTG/CTG0011390
Of course! Just think of it like a big ship!
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0011400
Hey, whaddya think of this outfit?
KSK/KSK0009290
Oh, that's so cute![nl]I think Rakuko would look amazing in that.
CTG/CTG0011410
What do you think, Rakuko-chan?
RAK/RAK0039540
H-Hmmmm. I'm not really super familiar with this stuff,[nl]so I don't know.
SSR/SSR0010850
You too, Mistress Rakuko? I'm the same way, actually.[nl]I'm terrible with this sort of thing.
CTG/CTG0011420
Okay, understood! Tsugumi, why not go over there[nl]and talk to Rakuko-chan? We'll pick something out for both of you!
SSR/SSR0010860
Very well.
CTG/CTG0011430
Oh....I like this outfit, too!
RAK/RAK0039550
Tsugumi....san, you're also not good[nl]at picking out clothing?
SSR/SSR0010870
Right. The Mistress chooses all the women's clothing I wear,[nl]but her choices are always a bit....flashy, or I should say, loud....
RAK/RAK0039560
But I think that's kind of cute.[nl]I find the way you're dressed very feminine, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0010880
N-No! I don't look feminine at all....![nl]I don't really like this much at all, and it really doesn't[nl]even suit me.
SSR/SSR0010890
....But I'm still happy that they're[nl]taking the time to pick something out for me.
RAK/RAK0039570
Well, I guess you're right.[nl]It is nice of them.
MRK/MRK0009820
Rakuko dearesssst! I found the perfect outfit for you![nl]Please try it on now!
RAK/RAK0039580
D-Did this store really have a dress with this many frills!?[nl]It looks like something Marie Antoinette would wear!
RAK/RAK0039590
Ummmm, I'm pretty happy with it,[nl]but it's not exactly my style....
MRK/MRK0009830
Oh, is that so?[nl]I think it would suit you perfectly.
MRK/MRK0009840
Well then, how about this one?
RAK/RAK0039600
(T-That one's also super frilly!)
RAK/RAK0039610
No, I think I'm looking for something a bit simpler,[nl]or more normal, even....
MRK/MRK0009850
I see, something simple![nl]Wait here just one moment.
RAK/RAK0039620
I-I hope it'll be okay....
SSR/SSR0010900
I-I hope so too....
RUR/RUR0007840
Rakuko, what do you think of this one?
RAK/RAK0039630
....Oh! Yes, yes,[nl]those are the sort of normal clothes I like?
RUR/RUR0007850
But this outfit seems a little bit too boyish, I think.[nl]Maybe I should look for something more languid.
RAK/RAK0039640
N-No, wait, Miyamoto![nl]That's exactly what I was looking for!
CTG/CTG0011440
Tsugumiiii! I was looking for a dress for Rakuko-chan[nl]and I found one that would be absolutely perfect on you!
SSR/SSR0010910
N-No! I'm not here to look for clothes for me today,[nl]I'm here for Mistress Rakuko....
RAK/RAK0039650
Well, this should be okay anyway, right?[nl]As long as we're here, we might as well get some stuff for you, Tsugumi.
CTG/CTG0011450
Thanks, Rakuko-chan! Unlike that bean sprout,[nl]you're a reasonable person!
RAK/RAK0039660
No, I feel like I would've said that in my old form, too....
CTG/CTG0011460
Hm? Did you say something?
RAK/RAK0039670
N-No! Nothing at all!
CTG/CTG0011470
....It's so weird. Every time I talk to you, Rakuko-chan,[nl]it feels just like I'm talking to Raku.
RAK/RAK0039680
Waagh!? O-O-Of course! People always say I look[nl]just like Raku, so that makes sense!
CTG/CTG0011480
Ohh, I see, I see!
CTG/CTG0011490
Come on, get in here, Tsugumi![nl]I'm closing the curtains!
SSR/SSR0010920
--------
CTG/CTG0011500
What are you crying for? This is a perfect outfit,[nl]so just leave it all to me!
RAK/RAK0039690
Tsugumi....I hope she's gonna be okay
KSK/KSK0009300
Hey, Rakuko. What do you think of this outfit?
RAK/RAK0039700
Wow, I gotta say it looks very 'you', Onodera....[nl]It's a very cute outfit.
KSK/KSK0009310
It's very 'me'?[nl]We just met today....right?
RAK/RAK0039710
Huh!? W-Well....[nl]I've heard about you from Raku.
KSK/KSK0009320
Huh? Ichijo told you about me!?[nl]I-I see....
RAK/RAK0039720
Uh....H-He didn't just tell me about you,[nl]Onodera....san, he told me about everyone!
KSK/KSK0009330
Oh, okay. I see....[nl]That makes sense.
SSR/SSR0010930
Eep!?
CTG/CTG0011510
Oh my, your chest won't fit....![nl]Tsugumi, your breasts have grown again, haven't they?
SSR/SSR0010940
T-That isn't what....[nl]GAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
CTG/CTG0011520
Alright, Rakuko-chan!
RAK/RAK0039730
Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes!? W-What is it!?
CTG/CTG0011530
You're up next. Here you go.
RAK/RAK0039740
What is this!? The skirt's too short!
CTG/CTG0011540
Hehehe. I'm really good at picking out these things.[nl]I promise it'll suit you, so just try it on!
Try it on
Straight-up refuse
RAK/RAK0039750
(G-Gaaah....![nl] It can't be helped....)
KSK/KSK0009340
Wowww.... Yes, I think that looks amazing on you![nl]You've got great taste, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0011550
Hehehe, of course.
RUR/RUR0007860
You should also try on the clothes Kosaki picked out for you.[nl]I'd like you to try on the ones I got, too.
MRK/MRK0009860
I've picked something out for you too,[nl]so you should totally try that on, too!
RAK/RAK0039760
Huh? I'm gonna try on all that!?
CTG/CTG0011560
You gotta try on a lot of stuff to know what looks good.
RAK/RAK0039770
M-Mghh.....[nl]Very well....
RAK/RAK0039780
Wha.... I-I can't wear that....![nl]I want to try on something different....
KSK/KSK0009350
But Chitoge picked it out, so it'll definitely look great![nl]Why not give it a try? Okay?
RAK/RAK0039800
N-No, really! please don't!
CTG/CTG0011570
Yeah, yeah, we're going back into the fitting room.
RAK/RAK0039810
Gaaaah!? W-Where do you think you're touching me!?
CTG/CTG0011580
It's because you moved so suddenly.[nl]I didn't mean to do that.
CTG/CTG0011590
But, Rakuko-chan, your boobs are bigger than I would've thought.
RAK/RAK0039820
Gaaaaah! N-Not there!?
CTG/CTG0011600
But we're both girls, so what's the problem?
RAK/RAK0039830
That's not the iss- GYAAAAAAH![nl]S-Stoppp iiitttt!
RAK/RAK0039840
Hahh.... Shopping with girls really is an ordeal....
RAK/RAK0039850
Hmmmm.... Huh?[nl]I can't get this on myself! How do I reach this zipper!?
OTM/OTM0004180
Let me assist thee, Raku.
RAK/RAK0039860
Aaaagh!
RAK/RAK0039870
....Wait, it's you, Otama?
RAK/RAK0039880
Hang on, you just called me 'Raku'![nl]You know who I am!?
OTM/OTM0004190
I do? I know thou art Raku?[nl]Of course I do.
RAK/RAK0039890
Thank goodness! You really are a goddess![nl]I'm not even sure what I'm gonna do now....
RAK/RAK0039910
Or I should say, I don't understand the situation to begin with![nl]Is this a dream? It's a dream, right, Otama?[nl]Please tell me this is a dream....!
OTM/OTM0004200
Hm? What's wrong?[nl]Art thou already finished studying women's hearts?
RAK/RAK0039920
I don't care about any of that stuff![nl]Aaagh, I just wanna be a guy again...!
OTM/OTM0004210
Hm? Is that right?
KSK/KSK0009360
Rakuko, what's going on in there?
RAK/RAK0039930
Oh, Otama! Hang on a second! Hey!
KSK/KSK0009370
Rakuko?
RAK/RAK0039940
Uhh, n-nothing![nl]The zipper in the back isn't going up!
KSK/KSK0009380
Oh, you want me to get that for you?[nl]I'll be right in, okay?
RAK/RAK0039950
Yeah....t-thanks.
.....
RAK/RAK0039960
It really is hard to change clothes on your own.[nl]I don't know how you all do it.
RAK/RAK0039970
Onodera, could you get this zipper for me?
RAK/RAK0039980
Onodera....?
RAK/RAK0039990
Hm?
RAK/RAK0040000
(What's this....?[nl] This familiar feeling....and my chest feels lighter....)

Mind explaining it to all of us?
RAK/RAK0040050
Ghh....!
KSK/KSK0009390
Um, Ichijo....[nl]I've been wondering for a while now, but what[nl]happened to Rakuko....?
RAK/RAK0040060
R-Rakuko, um....well....
RAK/RAK0040070
Right! I was helping her practice her magic tricks![nl]Ya know, like the one where two people magically switch places!
CTG/CTG0011660
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0040080
Maaaan, she has just been *really* into magic these days![nl]Of course, I didn't ask to be the practice dummy!
RAK/RAK0040090
(T-They didn't buy it?)
CTG/CTG0011670
Amazing! Rakuko's magic tricks are so cool!
@expose
KSK/KSK0009400
That really was amazing! Although that hardly seemed beginner-level.[nl]Is she a professional, by any chance?
RAK/RAK0040100
W-Who knows....[nl]I'm not quite sure myself....
SSR/SSR0010980
So where did she go?
RAK/RAK0040110
S-She, uh....[nl]She had to go back home, on some kind of urgent business....
RUR/RUR0007900
So why did you need to put on her clothes for this?
RAK/RAK0040120
H-Huh....? Well, she said it would make[nl]a bigger splash that way.
RUR/RUR0007910
I see. You aren't wearing those because[nl]you wanted to, then.
RAK/RAK0040130
Of course not! That's hardly my style at all!
KSK/KSK0009410
I-I see.... Thank goodness.
MRK/MRK0009890
Personally, even if that *was* your style,[nl]I'd still love you, no problem. ★
