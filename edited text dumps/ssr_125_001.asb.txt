....and she heard voices coming from the bathroom!
WSB/WSB0000140
Wowww, really!?
SSR/SSR0016310
Hm...?
@expose
SSR/SSR0016320
....Hey, Raku Ichijo. Lately the girls have been acting weird,[nl]why is that?
RAK/RAK0056780
I'm not quite sure myself.[nl]It's weird, they've all been so restless lately....
SYU/SYU0009460
Ahhhhem! I believe I might know the reason.
SSR/SSR0016330
No, go home.
@expose2
SYU/SYU0009470
Come on, aren't you cold.[nl]As long as I'm here, you might as well hear me out. Right?
RAK/RAK0056790
You're just trying to chat, aren't you....
SSR/SSR0016340
Aaagh, fine.[nl]Talk all you want.
SYU/SYU0009480
Actually, there's been strange happenings[nl]around this school lately.
RAK/RAK0056800
Strange happenings?
SYU/SYU0009490
Every school has them, they're called the Seven Wonders.[nl]Come on, you've heard them, right? Kinjiro Ninomiya walking[nl]the halls at night, or groans coming from the music room....
SSR/SSR0016350
Nghhh..... So it's this kind of thing.
SYU/SYU0009500
The one they're talking about right now[nl]is the greatest-of-the-greats infamous bathroom-stall ghost[nl]"Hanako-san of the Toilet".
SSR/SSR0016360
H-Hanako-san!?
RAK/RAK0056810
He's just being goofy again.
@ＢＧＭ停止
SYU/SYU0009510
Right....[nl]Here at Bonyari High School, in the second-floor girls'[nl]bathroom, she is said to lurk in the third stall from the door.
SYU/SYU0009520
It is said that long ago, while she was playing[nl]hide-and-seek with her friends, there was a big fire[nl]in the school.
SYU/SYU0009530
But she did not notice the fire, and remained in the stall,[nl]waiting for her friends to find her....
SSR/SSR0016370
Nghhhhh....
SYU/SYU0009540
Since she failed to escape, she is thus still in the stall,[nl]waiting to be found. And somehow, rumors of this[nl]began to spread.
SYU/SYU0009550
If you were to stand in front of that stall while it is empty,[nl]during the evening, and call out[nl]"Hanako-san, I found youuuuu!".....
SSR/SSR0016380
T-Then what....?
@画面揺らし2
SYU/SYU0009560
BOOOOOOM!
SSR/SSR0016390
Aaaaah!
SYU/SYU0009570
....She'd smash down the stall door and chase down[nl]whatever poor victims she can get her hands on,[nl]dragging them straight to the afterlife.
SYU/SYU0009580
Huh? What's wrong, Seishiro?[nl]Was what I said scary to you?
SSR/SSR0016400
N-Not a chance![nl]I was just startled by your sudden yelling, idiot!
RAK/RAK0056820
Don't tell me, Tsugumi....
You aren't great with ghost stories?
No, it's nothing
RAK/RAK0056830
You aren't great with ghost stories?
SSR/SSR0016410
Oogh....
RAK/RAK0056840
Ooh, so you have a surprisingly cute side, too.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0016420
T-That's not true at all!
RAK/RAK0056850
No, never mind....
RAK/RAK0056860
(I guess even Tsugumi has a fear or two....)
SSR/SSR0016430
Ghh! Why are you making that face!?[nl]Are you making fun of me!?
RAK/RAK0056870
Not at all. Everyone has something they're afraid of.
SSR/SSR0016440
I'M NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHIIIIING!
@ＨＰ－２５
RAK/RAK0056880
Gaah! Why did you hit me....?
SSR/SSR0016450
S-Shut up!
SSR/SSR0016460
Whether it's the ghost of Kinjiro or Hanako-san,[nl]I'll turn them into Swiss cheese in a matter of seconds!
RAK/RAK0056890
So you believe in ghosts, then.
SYU/SYU0009590
But unlike zombies,[nl]ghosts aren't affected by physical attacks, right?
SSR/SSR0016470
Huh!? They aren't!?
SYU/SYU0009600
Dunno. I've never seen them myself. ♪
SSR/SSR0016480
Ghh....[nl]This guy!
SSR/SSR0016490
A-Anyway, I'm not even afraid of ghosts![nl]I don't bother with such trifling rumors! Hmph!
SSR/SSR0016500
Waaaaagh!?
SYU/SYU0009610
Oh, sorryyyy. I dropped my bag. ♪
SSR/SSR0016510
Would you like me to make you a friend[nl]of Hanako-san and the others?
SYU/SYU0009620
Waaaagh! Time out, time out![nl]That's not funny!
RAK/RAK0056900
(I gotta say I'm surprised that[nl] Tsugumi's not great with ghosts.)
