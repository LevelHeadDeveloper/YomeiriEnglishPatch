@expose
OTM/OTM0006480
But, buuut! There is something very important[nl]that I must tell you right away!
RAK/RAK0065180
What's that important?
OTM/OTM0006490
The neighborhood cat made fun of me....
RAK/RAK0065190
Huh?
OTM/OTM0006500
The stray cat three doors down just went "hmph" at me![nl]He was treating me as though I was a child!
RAK/RAK0065200
Well, you *are* a child.
OTM/OTM0006510
So rude! I hath lived dozens of times longer than[nl]that piddly little cat!
OTM/OTM0006520
Waaaah! I'm so frustrated![nl]I must venteth this frustration somehow!
OTM/OTM0006530
....And that's what I've come to complain about.
RAK/RAK0065210
That is incredibly unimportant.
OTM/OTM0006540
No good! Dost thou not have a clever plan[nl]to make him eateth his words!?
RAK/RAK0065220
Clever plan, huh....[nl]I mean, your appearance being what it is....
RAK/RAK0065230
Hm? Appearance?[nl]I know. Hang on a second.
RAK/RAK0065240
Here, why don't you try this on?
OTM/OTM0006550
Oooh, is this....!?[nl]The skin of a tiger!? Didst thou kill it!?
RAK/RAK0065250
No, it's not a real tiger skin....[nl]It's a costume, like a stuffed toy animal you can wear.
RAK/RAK0065260
Don't you seem a lot stronger now?[nl]No guarantees it'll work, though....
OTM/OTM0006560
Mmhm, this is amazing![nl]I wasn't expecting this at all,[nl]but it seems this surprise item is actually useful!
RAK/RAK0065270
Give it back.
OTM/OTM0006570
Hahaha, talk not like that.[nl]I shall accept this gratefully.
OTM/OTM0006580
....Here, as thanks.
RAK/RAK0065280

OTM/OTM0006590
Roooar! You stray cat! I'm about to eat you![nl]Bwahahaha!
