So we're playing dodgeball in P.E. today.[nl]Kinda weird to be doing this in high school....[nl]But I'm pretty stoked because it's so nostalgic.
SYU/SYU0013890
Heh.... It's really quite simple, Raku.[nl]This game of dodgeball was brought about by all the guys[nl]in our class, who petitioned the teacher for it.
RAK/RAK0075310
Huh? Is that right?[nl]Why on earth would they....
SYU/SYU0013900
You'll find out once we get started.[nl]See ya, Raku.

Raku....[nl]Sometimes there are things in life that a man must do,[nl]even if he knows those things aren't the right thing.
RAK/RAK0075420

@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0012510
No worries, Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0012520
It's Kirisaki's fault for being attracted to[nl]*my* darling Raku, to begin with.
RAK/RAK0075450
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0012530
But it's no wonder you're so popular.[nl]You're so manly and interesting, Raku dearest.

MRK/MRK0012550
It is a bride-to-be's natural duty[nl]to protect her dearest Raku.
RAK/RAK0075460
H-Hey!? What the hell are you....
RAK/RAK0075470
Y-You guys have it all wrong![nl]There's a lot of complicated reasons for this....
