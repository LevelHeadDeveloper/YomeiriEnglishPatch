Ugh.....[nl]Just what is that sound......
CTG/CTG0001750
Those strange banging sounds aren't at all something[nl]you should hear at night in a school!
CTG/CTG0001760
Hey! Hurry up and explain that!
What are those sounds?
Probably a cat or something
SUMO PRACTICE!!
Drumming
Somebody's breaking plates, obviously.

A cat? Are those really noises a cat could make?
CTG/CTG0001780
Ah, but...... imagining that is a bit cute.
CTG/CTG0001790
"Bang, bang, bang" is the sound of sumo[nl]wrestlers slapping each other?
CTG/CTG0001800
But, our school doesn't have a sumo club, right?
CTG/CTG0001810
Which means....... It's a SUMO GHOST!?
CTG/CTG0001820
No! It ended up being a ghost after all!!
CTG/CTG0001830
I see, they're drums, huh.
CTG/CTG0001840
Now that you mention it, we had some drummers[nl]perform during the cultural festival.
CTG/CTG0001850
It's possible that they're just a bit overly enthusiastic[nl]and kept on practicing after the event...
CTG/CTG0001860
Dishes?[nl]Who the hell is breaking dishes at school at night!?
CTG/CTG0001870
Ha!? Actually thinking about it......[nl]I've heard of that! It's that, isn't it?
CTG/CTG0001880
The one where it's like[nl]"One, two, ......oops, I broke another"!
CTG/CTG0001890
A-a ghost was the culprit after all!!!!!!

CTG/CTG0001900
H-hey![nl]Say something already!!
@ctg_002_101_success
CTG/CTG0001910
Well if that's it..... I can live with that.[nl]Why don't we just ignore those sounds for now?
@ctg_002_102
@ctg_002_101_failure
CTG/CTG0001920
Ugh...... I-it's fine.[nl]For the time being, why don't we just ignore those sounds?
