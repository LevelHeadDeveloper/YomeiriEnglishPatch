....So, how have you been faring with Kirisaki these days?[nl]Why don'tcha go ahead and fill me in?
RAK/RAK0060450
The heck is with that character....
SYU/SYU0009900
How does her skin feel?
SYU/SYU0009910
Are her lips soft?
SYU/SYU0009920
No, maybe it's developed into something[nl]even further than that!?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0009930
Yeaaah, Raku, you're a pervert![nl]A dirty, lecherous pervert! ♪
RAK/RAK0060460
S-Shaddup....[nl]I mean, we haven't done anything....
SYU/SYU0009940
Well, that sounds right.[nl]You're not really the sort of person to be that proactive.
RAK/RAK0060470
The way you said that is pretty annoying....[nl]You do know Chitoge and I are just pretending to[nl]be dating, right?
SYU/SYU0009950
From where I stand, there's nothing wrong[nl]with a fake love blossoming into a real one.
RAK/RAK0060480
That's ridiculous![nl]First of all, there's Onodera....
SYU/SYU0009960
Well then, how are things with Onodera?
RAK/RAK0060490
Oogh....
RAK/RAK0060500
N-Nothing has particularly happened, as of right now....
@expose
SYU/SYU0009980
....Siggggghhhh.
RAK/RAK0060510
Hey! Stop with the exaggerated sighs!
SYU/SYU0009990
There's all these wonderful girls, like Marika and Seishiro too,[nl]all around you.... And here you are, doing what exactly....?
RAK/RAK0060520
Tsugumi? What does she have to do with anything?
SYU/SYU0010000
I'm sure if she heard that, she'd probably cry....[nl]No, she'd probably get angry and wallop you.
RAK/RAK0060530
Huh?
SYU/SYU0010010
Anyway! You need to start being more[nl]bold and proactive! For sure!
RAK/RAK0060540
W-Why do you figure?
SYU/SYU0010020
Because I find it amusing!
RAK/RAK0060550
....It was stupid of me to ask you a serious question.[nl]See ya.
SYU/SYU0010030
Hey, hang on. No matter how things unfold,[nl]I'm always rooting for your love. I'm on your side!
RAK/RAK0060560
You're such a smooth-talker....[nl]So, what about you?
RAK/RAK0060570
I've never heard you talking about your own love life much,[nl]but do you have a girlfriend?
SYU/SYU0010040
Hm? Hmmm....I guess maybe?
RAK/RAK0060580
That "I guess maybe" tells me you're making it up.
SYU/SYU0010050
Yeah....[nl]Well, I guess for me, it's more of a crush, or a[nl]feeling of admiration.
RAK/RAK0060590
Admiration....?
SYU/SYU0010060
Yeah, yeah. But let's talk about your strategy for[nl]conquering Onodera! And it's gotta be an interesting strategy, too!
RAK/RAK0060600
No way! Nothing good ever comes of[nl]following along with your schemes!
SYU/SYU0010070
Tsk, tsk, tsk....[nl]The keys to romance are feelings, timing, and then[nl]happenings....right?
SYU/SYU0010080
We just need to keep the happenings coming, as much as possible![nl]There might even be some "lucky accidents"!
RAK/RAK0060610
I've had enough of those already![nl]Gimme a break!
SYU/SYU0010090
Ughh.... You're so boring.
RAK/RAK0060620
(Good grief.[nl] It's not like I live to entertain this guy or anything....)
