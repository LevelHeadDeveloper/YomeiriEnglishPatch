SYU/SYU0013460
Hey, Raku, have you heard this one yet?
SYU/SYU0013470
It's one of Bonyari High's Seven Wonders. They say if you[nl]open the door to the rooftop the moment the sun sets, you[nl]see a vision of the one you're gonna marry behind the door!
RAK/RAK0070410
That sounds unbelievably fishy.
CTG/CTG0018620
Yeah, yeaaaah, I heard about that, too!
KSK/KSK0017820
Me too. It's a very popular story.
SSR/SSR0020880
But the details are a little different from what I heard.
SSR/SSR0020890
I believe it was that if you're waiting on the rooftop[nl]at the moment the sun sets, the man you're destined for will[nl]open the door and come out, or something like that.
SYU/SYU0013480
Oh, is that right?
MRK/MRK0011760
That's the version of the story the girls tell.[nl]Are you saying that the boy version and the girl version have[nl]slightly different content?
RAK/RAK0070420
Well, the Seven Wonders are just rumors,[nl]and half-baked ones at that.[nl]Sounds pretty dubious, doesn't it?

CTG/CTG0018630
Jeez, you've got no soul.
MRK/MRK0011770
Well, Raku dearest, shall you and I go verify this rumor?
RAK/RAK0070430
Huh? No, I don't really....
CTG/CTG0018640
You don't have to go with her, darling.[nl]You wouldn't see a vision of Marika anyway,[nl]even if the rumors are true.
MRK/MRK0011780
Oh, do tell, Kirisaki. You're saying that he will see a vision of[nl]*you* when he opens the door, rather than me?
CTG/CTG0018650
W-Well....[nl]I didn't say anything about me!
KSK/KSK0017830
Hey, hey, both of you.
RAK/RAK0070440
Onodera, are....you interested?[nl]In, like, seeing who you're going to marry....
KSK/KSK0017840
Huh, me!? U-Ummmm....
KSK/KSK0017850
Well....[nl]I'm about as interested as anyone else....I guess.
RAK/RAK0070450
I-I see.
RAK/RAK0070460
(The one Onodera's going to marry....[nl] Mmnnghhh....)
SSR/SSR0020900
The one Raku Ichijo's going to marry....
RAK/RAK0070470
Hm? What is it, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0020910
N-None of your business! Forget it....
SYU/SYU0013490
Ahh, but....
SYU/SYU0013500
It's entirely possible that when you open the door....[nl]There won't be anyone out there.[nl]Some people never get married.
RAK/RAK0070480
That's scary to think about.[nl]Better not carelessly try it.
MRK/MRK0011790
....I guess so.
