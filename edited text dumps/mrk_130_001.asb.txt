Phewww, what a day. I'm exhausted.
MRK/MRK0017290
Good work today, Raku dearest. ★
RAK/RAK0080320
It looks like she isn't here today,[nl]so I'll just spend the evening relaxing in my room....
MRK/MRK0017300
I see. Sometimes, it's nice to just relax in your room.
@expose
MRK/MRK0017310
By the way, who is "she"?
RAK/RAK0080330
Well, "she" would be Otama--

Wait, hey![nl]How'd you get into my room, Tachibana!?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0017320
What....I walked in with you, Raku dearest,[nl]and we both went into your room together, right?
MRK/MRK0017330
I was riiight behind you. ♪
RAK/RAK0080350
....You're freaking me out more and more, Tachibana.
@expose
MRK/MRK0017340
And I'm falling more and more in love with you. ★
RAK/RAK0080360
I'm too tired to argue anymore.[nl]....So, why are you here?
MRK/MRK0017350
I wanted to spend time with my darling Raku, of course....[nl]But while I'm here, can I ask you something?
RAK/RAK0080370
Don't know what you'd need to know after coming in here[nl]without permission.... Go ahead and ask me anything.
MRK/MRK0017360
I was wondering....
MRK/MRK0017370
Where do you keep your family's stamp?[nl]#fs{12}TN: Instead of signatures, people in Japan sign documents with a stamp.#fs{}
RAK/RAK0080380
Whaaa!?
What are you gonna do with that!?
I don't know.
RAK/RAK0080390
What are you gonna do with it!?
MRK/MRK0017380
Well, once I have your stamp,[nl]it will be useful for something in the future.
MRK/MRK0017390
Please don't worry. Aside from the marriage registration,[nl]I won't use it for anything on your behalf without permission.

RAK/RAK0080400
The heck you mean "don't worry"!?[nl]A marriage registration is what you shouldn't be stamping[nl]on my behalf without permission!
RAK/RAK0080410
I don't know where it is.[nl]My dad must keep it somewhere secure,[nl]but he never told me where.
MRK/MRK0017400
Is that so? That's a shame.
MRK/MRK0017410
It would have been very convenient to have[nl]your real stamp....
RAK/RAK0080420
(Even if I *did* know,[nl] there's no way I'd tell her....)
@expose
MRK/MRK0017420
It can't be helped.[nl]Since I've come all this way, let's at least look for it. ♪
RAK/RAK0080430
Hey! Stop trying to storm my room!
MRK/MRK0017430
Oh, I found your futon, Raku dearest![nl]Here we go.
MRK/MRK0017440
Hup!
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0080440
Why are you jumping into it!?
@ザクシャ万里花・大
MRK/MRK0017450
Ahhhh.... It smells like Raku dearest. ★
RAK/RAK0080450
Cut it out!
MRK/MRK0017460
Aah! Raku dearest, you're awfully bold to suddenly[nl]grab my shoulders from behind!★
RAK/RAK0080460
C・O・M・E ・ O・N![nl]Let go of my futon....!  
RYU/RYU0001880
Young master, you have friends over?[nl]Imma get them some tea and--

....Whoaaaaaa![nl]Pard'n me, young master!
RYU/RYU0001910
I'm....I'm so sorry I interrupted you during[nl]one of the most momentous steps you can take, young master!
RYU/RYU0001920
Right, don't pay me a bit o' mind, just continue![nl]Don't worry, I won't tell Miss Chitoge!
RAK/RAK0080480
Y-You idiot! Stop with the weird misunderstandings!
RYU/RYU0001930
Young master! Goood luuuck!
