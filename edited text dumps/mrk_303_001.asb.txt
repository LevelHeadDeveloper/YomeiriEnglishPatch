Jeez, why do I have to go all the way to the shrine[nl]to offer this inari sushi when the one we're offering it to[nl]is right here?
OTM/OTM0008160
Thou understandeth not.
OTM/OTM0008170
A meal isn't just how the food tasteth,[nl]but also where 'tis eaten and who 'tis eaten with.
RAK/RAK0081110
Who'd you hear that from?
@expose
OTM/OTM0008180
My grandma!
RAK/RAK0081120
Hmmmm..... Sounds like you've got a nice grandma.
OTM/OTM0008190
Mhm!
MRK/MRK0018030
Oh my, if it isn't Raku dearest!
MRK/MRK0018040
To think we'd run into each other here,[nl]this must be a "chance meeting". ♪
RAK/RAK0081130
Y-Yeah....[nl]But we're right in front of my house....
RAK/RAK0081140
Hey, Otama. Stay hidden.
OTM/OTM0008200
Worry not, I hath already disappeared.
MRK/MRK0018050
Hm? Is something the matter?
RAK/RAK0081150
N-No. It's nothing.
MRK/MRK0018060
Raku dearest ♪, it's a good thing I ran into you here....[nl]If you have time, why don't we go out together?
RAK/RAK0081160
Well, I'm free today, so I don't mind....
MRK/MRK0018070
Then let's go![nl]Honda's car "just happens" to be parked nearby as well,[nl]so let's have her drive us!
RAK/RAK0081170
I knew it! You came here specifically to wait for me![nl]What are you up to!?
RAK/RAK0081180
Hahh.... We can go out,[nl]but no hugging or anything!
MRK/MRK0018080
What about linking arms? Holding hands?
RAK/RAK0081190
Not those, either! If you don't like that, I'm not going.
MRK/MRK0018090
Mgh.... There's too many restrictions,[nl]but I can bear with that.
RAK/RAK0081200
Oh, hang on a second.
MRK/MRK0018100
Okay.
RAK/RAK0081210
Hey, Otama.[nl]You think you can get back to my room by yourself?
OTM/OTM0008210
No way. I shall follow thee.
......
RAK/RAK0081220
You sure? You won't mess with me or anything?
OTM/OTM0008220
Of course I shan't. ♪

RAK/RAK0081230
So, by "going out", you meant clothes-shopping?
MRK/MRK0018110
Yes! I thought I'd take this opportunity[nl]to investigate your tastes.
MRK/MRK0018120
Please don't worry. We're only window shopping.[nl]You're coming with me, right?
RAK/RAK0081240
Yeah, okay.
MRK/MRK0018130
Then why not start with a swimsuit?[nl]Raku dearest, please choose a swimsuit you think is cute.
RAK/RAK0081250
Why are we starting there!?[nl]Summers over, we don't need swimsuits!
@expose2
MRK/MRK0018140
You don't know that for sure.[nl]There's always the possibility that we'll go somewhere[nl]far out to the sea.
MRK/MRK0018150
Or rather, we might elope there!
RAK/RAK0081260
No! Let's just get something geared more towards[nl]fall or winter, okay?
MRK/MRK0018160
Mmmmmgh.... The way you put it has me second-guessing.[nl]From the beginning, I'd planned to start with swimsuits, and I even[nl]went out of my way to find a store that sells them....
RAK/RAK0081270
I don't understand your approach at all....
OTM/OTM0008230
Rakuuu. This swimsuit looketh like a piece of string.[nl]How art thou supposed to put it on?
RAK/RAK0081280
Hey! You're too young for that![nl]Leave it alone!
MRK/MRK0018170
So you have a taste for Brazilian bikinis, Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0081290
Huh!? N-No! It's just--!
MRK/MRK0018180
Do you think you can wait maybe 3....no, 2 more years[nl]so I can wear that perfectly?
RAK/RAK0081300
....You don't need to wear that in two years, okay?
@時間経過演出
MRK/MRK0018190
If you're gonna reject the swimsuit, then next....[nl]Why don't we pick out some clothes for you, Raku dearest?
MRK/MRK0018200
We don't need to buy them,[nl]let's just try a bunch of different clothes on you!
RAK/RAK0081310
No, I'm good.[nl]That kind of thing is embarrassing....
MRK/MRK0018210
No, Raku dearest! Remember, you're dating Kirisaki, right?[nl]....It hurts so much to say that myself.
MRK/MRK0018220
But anyway, I'm sure Kirisaki is dressed up nicely[nl]whenever you go out, and if you dress too perfunctorily,[nl]I'd feel bad for her.
RAK/RAK0081320
Ohh, that's a surprise.[nl]I didn't think you'd be thinking about Chitoge like that.
MRK/MRK0018230
Well, to be honest, I don't care about Kirisaki at all.[nl]I just want to see you in different outfits.
RAK/RAK0081330
Yeah. That's more what I expected.
MRK/MRK0018240
Well, shall we find some clothes that will look good on you?[nl]I'll be on the lookout!
MRK/MRK0018250
Let's start with this![nl]Tuxedo Raku Dearest. ★
RAK/RAK0081340
I tried my best to change into it, but....[nl]It's different from a regular suit, and this is a little[nl]embarrassing.
MRK/MRK0018260
Woaaaah![nl]What are you talking about, Raku dearest!?[nl]It suits you super well!
OTM/OTM0008240
Mhm. I suppose fine feathers *do* make fine birds.
MRK/MRK0018270
*pant* *pant.....[nl]May I take a picture?
OTM/OTM0008250
A-A photograph!?[nl]Thou shalt be drained of thy soul!
RAK/RAK0081350
Hey, why are you trying to take a picture, Tachibana!?
RAK/RAK0081360
....And Otama! You be quiet!
MRK/MRK0018280
And next up![nl]Fashion at odds with Raku dearest's desire for a quiet, peaceful life....
MRK/MRK0018290
Punk Rock Style!
RAK/RAK0081370
Hey, this doesn't suit me at all!
RAK/RAK0081380
Why is there so much jingling stuff on here!?[nl]And what's with all the bagginess and skulls and weird spikes!?
MRK/MRK0018300
No, no! It's not so bad.[nl]I think you look a lot more *dangerous* than before!
MRK/MRK0018310
Is this what they call "wild charm"!?[nl]If Raku dearest was by my side, I'm sure I'd awaken to all kinds of things!
OTM/OTM0008260
'Tis a wonderful world,[nl]putting skulls in fashion like this....
RAK/RAK0081390
Cut it out! I'm not gonna wear this again!
MRK/MRK0018320
And last but not least, Gyaruo Style! To be honest, I don't[nl]think this one fits your clean image.... but I'll give it a try. ♪[nl]#fs{12}TN: "Gyaruo" is the male equivalent of "gyaru", a Japanese fashion subculture.#fs{}
RAK/RAK0081400
....You're playing with me, aren't you?
MRK/MRK0018330
Don't be absurd.[nl]Now, show us what you look like!
RAK/RAK0081410
It's kinda....cramped. There's a lot of padding.
RAK/RAK0081420
It's also got a lot of zebra patterns,[nl]and it's also jingling and has skulls on it again.
MRK/MRK0018340
Oh, myyy....[nl]You look even more like a bad boy than I expected....
OTM/OTM0008270
Bahahahahahahaha!
MRK/MRK0018350
Oh, but there's something....[nl]Some mysterious charm about you that makes me feel[nl]like you'd lose your way without me.
MRK/MRK0018360
Don't worry, even if you go down this path, Raku dearest,[nl]I can still love you! Now I'm sure of that!
RAK/RAK0081430
You're really just cool with anything, aren't you!
OTM/OTM0008280
Wahahahaha!
RAK/RAK0081440
And *you'll* laugh at anything!
MRK/MRK0018370
Hehe....[nl]I had a good time seeing so many Raku dearests today.
RAK/RAK0081450
That's good....[nl]I was just tired of changing clothes so many times.
MRK/MRK0018380
In the end, you didn't buy a single piece of clothing.
RAK/RAK0081460
Naturally. I didn't want any of it,[nl]and it was all too expensive.
RAK/RAK0081470
But didn't you do the same thing?[nl]You didn't buy anything, but you're happy?
MRK/MRK0018390
There weren't any clothes I wanted, either.
MRK/MRK0018400
Besides, I enjoyed watching you try on clothes more,[nl]Raku dearest, so I was satisfied. I'm just happy to spend time with you.
RAK/RAK0081480
How can you say that without being embarrassed?
MRK/MRK0018410
I couldn't say those words for 10 whole years.[nl]I can say them as much as I want, okay?
RAK/RAK0081490
Even so, though....[nl]I'm still not sure how I'm supposed to respond.
MRK/MRK0018420
Do you not like it?
RAK/RAK0081500
Uhh.... It's not as though I don't like it.[nl]....I'm just kind of at a loss.
MRK/MRK0018430
Then, for now, please take it in stride.[nl]I don't need an answer immediately.
RAK/RAK0081510
I see....[nl]I guess if you're okay with it, I'd be glad to oblige....
MRK/MRK0018440
Yes.
MRK/MRK0018450
Well then, if you'll excuse me.
RAK/RAK0081520
Oh, it's this late already....
HND/HND0000920
Alright, Mistress, please head to the car.
RAK/RAK0081530
Honda, when did you....
OTM/OTM0008290
She hath been behind us the whole day.
RAK/RAK0081540
Seriously....
MRK/MRK0018460
Well then, Raku dearest,[nl]I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
RAK/RAK0081550
Okay, see you, Tachibana.
OTM/OTM0008300
What a lovely girl.
RAK/RAK0081560
....Yeah.
OTM/OTM0008310
Shall we go back, too?[nl]To our house.
RAK/RAK0081570
It's *my* house.
