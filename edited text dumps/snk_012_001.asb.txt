Raku Ichijo, can you hear me?
RAK/RAK0082550
Oh, Tsugumi. It's unusual for you to call me.
SSR/SSR0021360
I'm monitoring your location from a distance...
SSR/SSR0021370
Earlier, Claude and I were supposed to have[nl]a meeting regarding monitoring you, but...
SSR/SSR0021380
...Why is Claude chasing you right now?[nl]He should have been back ages ago![nl]Explain, right now!
RAK/RAK0082560
I don't know! He didn't tell me![nl]Hold on, how much effort are you putting into[nl]watching me?
SSR/SSR0021390
Hmm... From what I can see,[nl]it doesn't look like it was your fault.
SSR/SSR0021400
Perhaps Claude misunderstood something.[nl]For now, I will help with your escape.
SSR/SSR0021422
Press ○ to crouch,[nl]While you're crouching, you cannot be [nl]seen through obstacles.
SSR/SSR0021445
However, you can't move while crouching.[nl]When you're out of danger, use ○ to stand up[nl]and × to dash.
SSR/SSR0021431
When it gets dangerous, duck behind something[nl]and press ○. When it's safe, keep moving.[nl]That is the basis of infiltration. Remember that.
RAK/RAK0082575
Infiltration...?[nl]I'm just trying to get the hell out of school.
SSR/SSR0021435
Don't spend so much time talking.[nl]Do you want to be found?
SSR/SSR0021410
See those pillars in the back of the classroom?[nl]I managed to stay of of Claude's sight by[nl]ducking behind one of those.
RAK/RAK0082570
I see... Then, it's possible that I could also[nl]hide behind one of these pillars.
SSR/SSR0021430
Also, keep an eye on the floor. There's all kinds[nl]of junk on there that will make a noise if you[nl]step in it.
RAK/RAK0082580
Roger. I'll be careful.[nl]Thank you very much, I appreciate the help!
SSR/SSR0021440
Mmm. Good luck.
