Not here! Not here! It's not here, either![nl]Any sign of it yet, Ryuu!?
RYU/RYU0001330
It's not here, either, young master!
RAK/RAK0059800
Gaaah! Where'd my wallet go!?
RAK/RAK0059810
If I can't find my wallet, we'll have to eat bean sprouts[nl]for the whole rest of the month!
RYU/RYU0001340
P-Please don't make us do that!!
RAK/RAK0059820
Who could it be when we're so busy, jeez!?
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0019170
Sorry for coming when you're so busy.
RAK/RAK0059830
Tsugumi!?
@expose
SSR/SSR0019180
I could hear your yelling from out here.[nl]You are a nuisance.
RAK/RAK0059840
S-Sorry. I was a little panicked....
SSR/SSR0019190
Heh. Was it because you dropped this, perchance?
RAK/RAK0059850
Aaaaah!!!! My wallet!?
SSR/SSR0019200
It fell out of your shoe locker at school. Dropping something[nl]this important just goes to show how slack you are.
RAK/RAK0059860
Thank you, Tsugumi! I'm in your debt!

SSR/SSR0019210
Heh....[nl]Well, anyway, I'm glad it was found.
RAK/RAK0059870
Yeah, I didn't think you'd be bringing it to me,[nl]but I'm so glad you did!
SSR/SSR0019220
I don't really care about you one way or another....[nl]But if you're sad, you'll make the Mistress sad, too.[nl]That's all there is to it.
RAK/RAK0059880
Well, I'm glad either way![nl]You could have waited until school to bring it to me,[nl]but you went out of your way to bring it to my house!
SSR/SSR0019230
I was in the neighborhood on another errand,[nl]so I figured I'd drop by.[nl]If it wasn't for that, who would come all the way here?
SSR/SSR0019240
Well, I'm off. Try not to drop that again.
RAK/RAK0059890
Okay, see you at school!
RAK/RAK0059900
You're such a great person, Tsugumi![nl]I've never been so thankful in my life!
RAK/RAK0059910
(....But, what was she doing in the neighborhood?)
