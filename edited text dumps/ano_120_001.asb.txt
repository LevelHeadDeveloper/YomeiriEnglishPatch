RAK/RAK0064310

RYU/RYU0001360

RAK/RAK0064320

RYU/RYU0001390

So.... All the usual suspects again, huh.
MRK/MRK0011430
Well, if you didn't want to come,[nl]there's no need to force yourself.

KSK/KSK0017390
H-Hey, hey. Let's not fight,[nl]and we can go see what Mr. Ryuu wants.
@時間経過演出2
RYU/RYU0001400
Wowww, thanks, young master![nl]Ev'ryone, thanks for coming.
RAK/RAK0064340
So, what did you need from us?
RYU/RYU0001410
Dere's an autumn flea market goin' on today.[nl]We're helpin' the shrine with dat as a way of[nl]contributin' to our local community....
RYU/RYU0001420
Dis year, we decided to hold a costume party[nl]to coincide with Halloween. We bought all these[nl]great costumes, but....
RAK/RAK0064350
Don't tell me you're gonna wear these?
RYU/RYU0001430
....We were, but then we got complaints dat our[nl]faces were to scary to pull it off in a silly way.
CTG/CTG0015350
That tracks....[nl]Our guys don't really do Halloween costumes, either.
RYU/RYU0001440
But if we don't do somethin', the whole project's gonna[nl]fall apart. So if y'all don't mind, could you young'uns[nl]take our place and do the costume contest instead?
@expose
KSK/KSK0017400
Huh!? W-We're going to wear these!?
RYU/RYU0001450
Yup. You all look like lovely young ladies.[nl]So please! Help us out!

RYU/RYU0001460
I'm beggin' you![nl]Da children in town were all lookin' forward to it!
SSR/SSR0020420
Well, but....
CTG/CTG0015360
I'm cool with it.[nl]Seems like fun.
MRK/MRK0011440
Me too! How could I refuse a request from[nl]a member of Raku dearest's family!?
RUR/RUR0012510
Me too. I don't care either way.[nl]But I'd like to ask Kosaki to choose a sexy costume,[nl]one that'll make Ichijo's heart miss a beat.
KSK/KSK0017410
Ruri, why!?
RAK/RAK0064360
I'm begging you, Tsugumi.[nl]I can't just leave Ryuu to deal with this himself.
SSR/SSR0020430
....Hahh.[nl]Seems like I'm the odd one out here.
SSR/SSR0020440
As long as the Mistress and her friends are okay with it,[nl]I have no reason to object.
RYU/RYU0001470
Wow! Thanks, ladies![nl]Looks like today's gonna be a great Halloween!
RYU/RYU0001480

Hey, heeey![nl]Gimme candy or I'll play a trick on you!
SSR/SSR0020450
W-Why am I the only one wearing[nl]this bandage costume!? Being dressed like this[nl]is too embarrassing....!
KSK/KSK0017420
Kyaah!? Don't pull on my tail![nl]It'll make the rest of the costume come off!
MRK/MRK0011450
Raku dearessst![nl]Feast your eyes on my sexy costume! ♪
RUR/RUR0012520

RYU/RYU0001490

MRK/MRK0011460
I am very fond of this costume.[nl]May I take it home?
RYU/RYU0001500
Sure. I don't think we'll be wearin' it next year anyway,[nl]so be my guest.
RUR/RUR0012530
I might want to keep mine, too....
SYU/SYU0012780
That outfit was perfect for you, Ruri![nl]The sort of costume where the shape of[nl]your body doesn't ma--
SYU/SYU0012790
.....Owblgblgblghh!
RUR/RUR0012540
While I'm here, I might as well help you with the trash, too.[nl]I have some trash here I'd like to incinerate.
RAK/RAK0064370
Hey, hey, don't go incinerating Shuu!
RYU/RYU0001510
Anyway, ev'ryone,[nl]thanks fer yer help today.
RYU/RYU0001521
There will be a gift exchange on the last day of[nl]the flea market, so please come join us fer that if ya can.
RAK/RAK0064381
