Alright, I should check on the animals for a bit.
RAK/RAK0055550
These days, it's been so hectic,[nl]I've barely had any time to look in on them.
RAK/RAK0055560
Well, not like they like me that much[nl]to begin with. Hahaha!
RAK/RAK0055570
....Ooogh, it makes me sad to say it myself.
SSR/SSR0015120
Gootchie gootchie....hehe.[nl]Your fuzziness is quite something.
RAK/RAK0055580
Hm...?

SSR/SSR0015130
Gootchie gootchie.... Good boy, meow....[nl]You really are quite fuzzy, meow.
RAK/RAK0055590
(D-Did she just....meow?[nl] Um, Tsugumi?)
SSR/SSR0015140
And your footpads are so squishy, meow.[nl]Does that feel good, meow?
RAK/RAK0055600
(Uhhhh, what should I do....?)
Say something
Keep watching
RAK/RAK0055610
What are you doing, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0015150
Waaaagh!? R-Raku Ichijo!?[nl]What are you doing here!?
RAK/RAK0055620
Well, it's my job to take care of the animals.[nl]I figured I'd stop by here and do that for a bit....[nl]How about you?
SSR/SSR0015160
Um, well....
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
RAK/RAK0055630
Could it be you were playing with them?
@expose
RAK/RAK0055640
(No, this is kind of interesting,[nl] so I think I'll stay and watch the rest....)
KTN/KTN0000010
Meow!
SSR/SSR0015170
That's right, that's right.[nl]Feels good, doesn't it.
SSR/SSR0015180
Ohh, you're so, so cute....[nl]You're so cute, I can't help but sigh.
SSR/SSR0015190
Hmm....but we can't do this anymore.[nl]I have to go before I get too attached to you.
KTN/KTN0000020
Mew?
SSR/SSR0015200
No, don't try to take me in like that.[nl]You'll make it even harder for me to leave you....
KTN/KTN0000030
SSR/SSR0015210
Ooogh, no, don't look at me with those vacant eyes![nl]It won't work. I'm away on assignment a lot,[nl]and I'm not qualified to keep a living creature!
KTN/KTN0000040
Meowww!
SSR/SSR0015220
Waaaaaaghh!
RAK/RAK0055650
(Hmmmmm, now I feel kinda sorry for her....)
RAK/RAK0055660
Tsugumi.
RAK/RAK0055670
Well, it's my job to take care of the animals.[nl]I figured I'd stop by here and do that for a bit....
RAK/RAK0055680
Were you playing with these guys?
SSR/SSR0015230
----
SSR/SSR0015240
Yeah, I was! You got a problem with that!?[nl]Why not just come out and say it, hmm!?
RAK/RAK0055690
Why are you mad!?
SSR/SSR0015250
Shut up![nl]What's so wrong with me playing with the animals!?
RAK/RAK0055700
Nothing whatsoever. It's rather helpful.
SSR/SSR0015260
Huh? Helpful?
RAK/RAK0055710
Watch.
RAK/RAK0055720
Alright, it's playtime,[nl]Cyclops Gengar Suzaku!!
CRN/CRN0000010
Cawwww!!
@ＨＰ－１０
RAK/RAK0055730
....See?
SSR/SSR0015270
Well....[nl]What? So what you're saying is....
RAK/RAK0055740
They don't listen to me at all when I'm the one[nl]interacting with them. None of them do.
RAK/RAK0055750
So, if you play with them once in a while,[nl]relieve their stress, that'd be great.
SSR/SSR0015280
I-I see....[nl]In that case, I'd be happy to stop by occasionally....
RAK/RAK0055760
Yeah, please do.[nl]I'm sure they'll all be happy to see you.
SSR/SSR0015290
But....don't tell a soul what you saw here.[nl]If word got out that one of the Beehive's top fighters[nl]was playing with a kitten, I'd be ruined.
RAK/RAK0055770
I don't think anyone would really care about that, right?
SSR/SSR0015300
Well, I care![nl]Just do as I say!
RAK/RAK0055780
Okay, okay, I won't tell anyone.
SSR/SSR0015310
Alright....[nl]Well then, I'm gonna play with these guys some more.
SSR/SSR0015320
Raku Ichijo, you come too.[nl]Give me some information about the rest of these animals.
RAK/RAK0055790
Sure. Thanks for helping.
