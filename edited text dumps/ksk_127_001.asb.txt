"Ideal Man" edition?[nl]It's unusual for you to read that sort of magazine, Kosaki.
KSK/KSK0014870
Yeah. Adashi lent it to me earlier and told me[nl]to read it because it was interesting.
SYU/SYU0008570
Raku, do you hear what they're talking about?[nl]This topic piques my interest very much....
SYU/SYU0008580
Let's stick around and pay extra close attention[nl]to whatever bits of conversation we happen to hear.
RAK/RAK0050010
S-Sure....
KSK/KSK0014880
But everyone here picked such an amazing ideal guy.[nl]I wonder if guys like that really do exist.
RUR/RUR0011450
They call them "ideal" because they don't exist.[nl]Such a convenient guy cannot exist.
RUR/RUR0011460
Isn't that right, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0050020
!!
RAK/RAK0050030
....Uh, s-since I only just entered the conversation,[nl]I-I don't have a clue what you're talking about!
RUR/RUR0011470
....I'm saying that the "ideal man" for girls doesn't exist.[nl]Wouldn't you agree?
SYU/SYU0008590
Hey, what exactly are the qualifications for "ideal man"?[nl]The way you're talking about it, it sounds like a pretty[nl]high bar.
@expose
KSK/KSK0014890
Y-Yeah. According to this magazine,[nl]he's competent enough to survive the recession,[nl]smart enough to make his own way in the world....
KSK/KSK0014900
He's physically fit, tall and handsome,[nl]makes over 8 million yen every year, is kind,[nl]listens to anything a girl says... and also, ummm....
RAK/RAK0050040
Onodera, stop. Yes, I understand that[nl]such a high-spec man is very sought-after.
RUR/RUR0011480
Well, according to the magazine, anyway.[nl]Not every woman in the world thinks so.
SYU/SYU0008600
I appreciate that very much.[nl]By the way, Onodera, what would your ideal man be like?
KSK/KSK0014910
Huh? M-Mine!?
RAK/RAK0050050
(Shuu, good job!)
KSK/KSK0014920
I guess....yeah.[nl]I'd like....someone kind. Who uses his strength[nl]to help others, instead of himself.
RAK/RAK0050060
Wow, that's good.
KSK/KSK0014930
Y-Yeah....
RAK/RAK0050070
(....Huh? Onodera looked away from me so fast![nl] Did I do something wrong!?)
RUR/RUR0011490
Alright, Ichijo, you're up next.[nl]Tell us about your ideal girl, please.
RAK/RAK0050080
Huh!? M-My ideal girl!?
@expose
KSK/KSK0014940
W-Wait! Ruri!
RUR/RUR0011500
Don't you wanna hear this, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0014950
Ummmm, well....
KSK/KSK0014960
Y-You know, if you don't want to tell us,[nl]you don't have to....
RAK/RAK0050090
N-No! I'm totally fine telling you![nl]Let's see....my ideal girl would be a girl who....
....is liked by animals.
....gives me a bandage when I'm injured
RAK/RAK0050100
The kind of girl that the animals love.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0014970
Huh.... I-I see....
RAK/RAK0050110
(Oh, oh no![nl] She just looked away again!)
RAK/RAK0050120
The sort of girl who would give me a bandage if I got hurt.
KSK/KSK0014980
I guess that....huh? That's....
RAK/RAK0050130
N-No....![nl]I just meant I'd like a girl who's kind!
KSK/KSK0014990
Ah..... T-That's what you meant![nl]Hahahaha!
@ザクシャ小咲・中
SYU/SYU0008610
.....Pfft. Mwhehehehe.....
RUR/RUR0011510
Completely and utterly spineless....
