Oh, Miyamoto. Swim practice over?
RUR/RUR0010030
....Yup.
RUR/RUR0010040
Hahhh.
RAK/RAK0043970
What? Did I say something strange?
RUR/RUR0010050
No, not really.[nl]What, do you think you said something strange?
RAK/RAK0043980
No, that's not it![nl]Why are you making that face then? You look really grumpy.
RUR/RUR0010060
Oh,. sorry about that.[nl]I've got some water in my ear and I just can't get it out.
RUR/RUR0010070
Normally it comes out pretty easily,[nl]but today it's just not budging....
RAK/RAK0043990
Oh, so that's it. I'll bet it feels like there's something[nl]in the back of your ears that's making them ring,[nl]and it's making you feel sick.
RUR/RUR0010080
It's hard to hear you, too.[nl]Don't worry, you haven't offended me.
RAK/RAK0044000
Hey, what is it you do to get the water[nl]out of your ears, usually?
RUR/RUR0010090
I shake my head.
RAK/RAK0044010
Anything else?
@expose
RUR/RUR0010100
Not that I know of.
RAK/RAK0044020
I have this trick I use sometimes.[nl]You take a pocket tissue....
RAK/RAK0044030
And you tie a tight knot in one corner.[nl]....Here, put this in your ear slowly.
RUR/RUR0010110
Hmmm.

RAK/RAK0044040
Hey, Miyamoto, do you have any tissues?
RUR/RUR0010120
Yep. Here you go.
RAK/RAK0044050
Thank you. Just roll a tissue or two into a kind of a rope....[nl]Then put it *gently* into your ear.
......
RUR/RUR0010130
....Oh, it actually worked.
RAK/RAK0044060
Surprisingly easy to get it out that way, right?[nl]You don't even have to shake your head.

@expose2
RUR/RUR0010140
For the first time, I'm actually impressed with you.
RAK/RAK0044070
....F-For the first time?
RUR/RUR0010150
Yes, for the first time.
RAK/RAK0044080
....Oh, okay.[nl]That's great to hear....
