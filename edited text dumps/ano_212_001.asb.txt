What do you want, Otama?[nl]Didn't I just play with you?
OTM/OTM0007040
That's not what I want.[nl]Dost thou not have any wishes?
RAK/RAK0065830
Wishes? Hmmm, I can't really say there's anything[nl]I need you to do for me....
@expose
OTM/OTM0007050
Art thou certain? Absolutely certain?
RAK/RAK0065840
Yep. First of all, you gotta work for your wishes.[nl]I'm not gonna ask a goddess to help me with mine.
OTM/OTM0007060
Mghhh.... Then thou art completely denying the[nl]value of my existence! Demon! Fiend! Yokai!
RAK/RAK0065850
But you're the yokai here....
OTM/OTM0007070
Just make a wish, no matter what it is!
RAK/RAK0065860
Aaargh, shut up.[nl]Fine, fine.
RAK/RAK0065870

(Seems like she's cheered up, anyway.)
RAK/RAK0065900
(But, what is this....happy feeling?[nl] I guess this is what it feels like when[nl] a child gives you a shoulder massage....)
