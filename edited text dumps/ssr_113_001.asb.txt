Hey, Tsugumi. What is it you did in the U.S.?
SSR/SSR0014300
Hmmm....you mean before I came to Japan?
KSK/KSK0016750
Now that you mention it,[nl]I don't know a lot about you from back then.
MRK/MRK0010760
She's full of mysteries. Very interesting.
SSR/SSR0014310
It's not really such a big deal.[nl]Besides, it's not pleasant to talk about....
SYU/SYU0009190
You're sounding awfully reluctant to speak. You know every[nl]detail, don't you, Chitoge? Thisss thing about Seishiro,[nl]or thaaat thing about Seishiro.... ★
SSR/SSR0014320
Every time you open your mouth, you irritate me....
CTG/CTG0014290
Hmmm.....I actually don't know that much about it.[nl]Dad and Claude never really talk to me much about[nl]their work....
MRK/MRK0010770
Hmmmm.....now I'm even *more* suspicious.[nl]I'll bet you've got a *fellow* over there[nl]that you're *great* friends with.
SSR/SSR0014330
There's no such guy!
@expose
CTG/CTG0014300
Ah....but Tsugumi *is* quite popular[nl]among our guys, right?
SSR/SSR0014340
E-Et tu, Mistress!?
CTG/CTG0014310
That's because she's capable of taking down entire[nl]organizations by herself, and as young as she is,[nl]she's already completed several jobs.
CTG/CTG0014320
From an enemy standpoint, she's the most powerful assassin[nl]and it's said there have been forces that surrendered[nl]at the mere mention of the name "Tsugumi".
RAK/RAK0054830
Wow....That's awesome.
CTG/CTG0014330
Heheh. Right?[nl]I'll bet that's why all the guys in the Beehive[nl]call her "Big Bro" and respect her!
KSK/KSK0016760
Huh? "Big Bro"?
RAK/RAK0054840
Hey..... Isn't that kinda the wrong nickname?
CTG/CTG0014340
Huh? Is it?
SYU/SYU0009200
Obviously, it's just a token of respect from her peers, right?[nl]It doesn't matter to them that she's the opposite sex.
MRK/MRK0010780
But why would they call you "Big Bro"?[nl]In the movies, it's always "ma'am" or "Big Sis".
SSR/SSR0014350
Because, ummm....
SSR/SSR0014360
Like Claude, they're all clueless and[nl]they all still think I'm a boy....
KSK/KSK0016770G
Huh....?
SYU/SYU0009210
I'm not quite sure how to say this....
RAK/RAK0054850
....I have no clue how the Beehive[nl]made it this far with how dense they are.
