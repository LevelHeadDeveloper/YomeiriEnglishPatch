Hahh....
RAK/RAK0077040
....It's been more than half a year now[nl]since we started high school.[nl]It sounds like a long time, but it flew by....
SYU/SYU0014120
Come on, Raku![nl]Aren't you a little young to be reminiscing?
RAK/RAK0077050
I guess maybe I am....
RAK/RAK0077060
But at this rate, the rest of high school,[nl]college, and even employment will be over in the [nl]of an eye, and that's kinda got me down.
CTG/CTG0023280
You old man....is what I'd like to call you,[nl]but I think you're right. I've also been thinking a lot[nl]lately about how time flies.
@expose
SSR/SSR0021190
Time flies like an arrow, they say.[nl]I feel the same way.
KSK/KSK0018180
Once we graduate and get jobs....[nl]I wonder where we'll all be then.
RUR/RUR0012730
I can't help but wonder if at least one wil be married.[nl]Riiight, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0018190
R-Ruri!
SYU/SYU0014130
With all the connections I have,[nl]I'm sure I can have an interesting life.
SSR/SSR0021200
I....
SSR/SSR0021210
......
SSR/SSR0021220
....No, never mind.[nl]I'd be content to work with the mistress, as I always have.
SSR/SSR0021230
I'd be content to work with the mistress, as I always have.
RAK/RAK0077070
You both seem to have very vague plans for the future....
CTG/CTG0023290
What about you, Darling?
RAK/RAK0077080
Me? Well, I want to--
Be an upstanding civil servant!
Take over the family business
Be a house-husband
RAK/RAK0077090
I'd be happy if I could have a peaceful life[nl]as a public servant.
SSR/SSR0021240
Walking the straight and narrow, huh.[nl]I'd say that's a good choice....
SSR/SSR0021250
....If it wasn't completely impossible.[nl]Do you really think you could be the mistress's lover[nl]with resolve like that?
RAK/RAK0077100
S-Shut up. A man can dream!
RAK/RAK0077110
Lately, I've been thinking it might not be so[nl]bad to take over the Shuei-gumi.
CTG/CTG0023300
Oooh. That's surprising.
RAK/RAK0077120
Of course, I don't think I'm cut out for the whole[nl]hacking-and-slashing thing.
RAK/RAK0077130
But, there are other ways to lead a group,[nl]and after watching our dads for a while, I can't say[nl]they haven't been making an effort....
RAK/RAK0077140
I'd like to be a house-husband....
RUR/RUR0012740
....As skilled as you are at housework,[nl]that's certainly an option for you, Ichijo.
KSK/KSK0018200
Yes. He'd be a good family-oriented father.
RAK/RAK0077150
Haha.... Well, I was just kidding.
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0013940
Ahem! Let me tell you all my dream for the future.[nl]I'm going to--
CTG/CTG0023310G
You don't need to tell us.
MRK/MRK0013950
Mgh....[nl]That's just cold, guys!
RAK/RAK0077160
Well, it was so obvious what you were gonna say....
MRK/MRK0013960
Well then, Raku dearest, you can make my dream come true, right?[nl]My dream is....
MRK/MRK0013970
....to be the wife of a public servant!
MRK/MRK0013980
....to be the matriarch of the Ichijo family!
MRK/MRK0013990
....to be a career woman supporting her house-husband!
