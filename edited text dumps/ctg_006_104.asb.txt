The original Chitoge wished me into existence because[nl]she was so tired of herself, right?
MTG/MTG0001340
As for me, I can't think of a single thing[nl]the original has over me.
MTG/MTG0001350
So, these strong points the original has and I don't.[nl]Hehehe....what are they, exactly?
What are they?
Genuine kindness
I spent longer with her
MTG/MTG0001360
You mean....the time between when she[nl]entered high school and now?
MTG/MTG0001370
Hehe....hehehehe!
MTG/MTG0001380
I'm sorry, but that just isn't the case.
MTG/MTG0001390
Haven't you forgotten?[nl]I'm her "other self", if you will, created from the original....
MTG/MTG0001400
And I have the same memories of those six months[nl]with you that the original does, Mr. Raku.
MTG/MTG0001410
So there's nothing left that the original[nl]could possibly have over me, right?
MTG/MTG0001420
So there's no reason to hesitate![nl]Choose me, please!

MTG/MTG0001430
Kinda hard to think of one, right?[nl]Come on, there's no need to rack your brain.
MTG/MTG0001440
Come on! choose me, please!
