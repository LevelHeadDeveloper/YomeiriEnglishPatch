Hey, Shuu. Let's go home together.
SYU/SYU0004230
Oh, sorry, Raku.[nl]I have other business today.
RAK/RAK0030990
Business?
RAK/RAK0031000
Actually, you have been disappearing during free period,[nl]and also between classes.... What's going on?
SYU/SYU0004240
Wellll, that's kinda classified.[nl]Sorry, I can't tell you.
RAK/RAK0031010
What the hell, that's totally suspicious.
SYU/SYU0004250
Hehehe....[nl]Well, let's just say I'm fulfilling my goal.
RAK/RAK0031020
Your goal....the beautiful-girl-photo-book?[nl]That's impossible since Ruri destroyed your camera, right?
SYU/SYU0004260
Well, that's how it should be.[nl]Officially.
RAK/RAK0031030
Huh? What do you mean?
SYU/SYU0004270
Ooops, I'm running late![nl]See you later, Raku! Have a nice day!
RAK/RAK0031040
H-Hey!
RAK/RAK0031050
....What the hell's up with him?
RAK/RAK0031060
I kinda thought he'd take a while to recover from the [nl]other day, but he's very lively today.
RAK/RAK0031070
I have a bad feeling about this.
RUR/RUR0004340
....Hey, you got a second, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0031080
Hm? Miyamoto?
RAK/RAK0031090
W-What's the matter?[nl]You've got a protruding vein on your forehead....
@expose
RUR/RUR0004350
That isn't the problem.[nl]What is this booklet?
RAK/RAK0031100
Booklet? What booklet?
RUR/RUR0004360
Here, look at this photo.
RAK/RAK0031120
Huh? Isn't this you with your mouth full of cake?[nl]This is from the other day at that cafe, isn't it.
RUR/RUR0004370
I was so careless....[nl]I can't believe he got a picture of my stupid face[nl]with my huge mouth that wide open....
RAK/RAK0031130
Well, I think it looks cute and innocent.[nl]Depending on how you look at it.
RUR/RUR0004380
Excuse me. That's not the point!
RUR/RUR0004390
The point is that Maiko took these photos secretly!
RAK/RAK0031140
Yeah, that's right.[nl]But I thought you broke the camera then....
RUR/RUR0004400
Yes, I did.[nl]But still this booklet got made.
RUR/RUR0004410
And I'm not the only one in it.[nl]There's everyone in their swimsuits from the other day....[nl]It's chock-full of shameless photography!
RAK/RAK0031150
Wow....it is.[nl]Miyamoto, where'd you get this booklet?
RUR/RUR0004420
Some boys were looking at in the classroom just now.[nl]When I confiscated it and questioned them,[nl]do you know where they said they got it?
RUR/RUR0004430
They got it from a black market run by Maiko.
RAK/RAK0031160
(Oh, great....he's finished the photo book!)
RUR/RUR0004440
....and you know what that means, Ichijo.[nl]I suspect you are also involved.
RAK/RAK0031170
Huh!?
@expose2
RUR/RUR0004450
You pretend you're sorry, but you[nl]sneak around making photo books anyway....[nl]How absolutely horrendous.
RAK/RAK0031180
H-Hang on, you misunderstand![nl]I thought there wasn't any more talk of a photo book!
RUR/RUR0004460
I dunno. You can say whatever you feel like, right?
RAK/RAK0031190
(Crap, she thinks I'm totally complicit....)
RAK/RAK0031200
(I've gotta clear up this misunderstanding somehow!)
