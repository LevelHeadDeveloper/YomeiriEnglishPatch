Haaahh..... Time to spend the end of the day[nl]playing with cute animals....[nl]What an incredible, heartwarming time!
NIW/NIW0000080
Buckaw! Buck buck buck buckaw!
RAK/RAK0069500
Hahahaha, this guy.
CTG/CTG0017720
No no, that chicken definitely dislikes you.[nl]You just aren't likeable enough to him.
RAK/RAK0069510
You could at least learn his name.[nl]He's called "Crusher Kato"!
@expose
CTG/CTG0017730
I'm not gonna remember that name.[nl]Let's just go with "Kato".
NIW/NIW0000090
Buckaw! Buck buck buck buck buck.
RAK/RAK0069520
Look, Crusher Kato is rejecting your idea![nl]He likes his original name better!
NIW/NIW0000100
BUCKAW, BUCKBUCKBUCKBUCK!
CTG/CTG0017740
No, it sounds to me like he's not too crazy[nl]about the name you gave him either....
CTG/CTG0017750
Also, he's been pecking at you for a while now.[nl]Doesn't that hurt?
RAK/RAK0069530
It doesn't hurt as long as I have love!
CTG/CTG0017760
That's sad....[nl]Raku, I feel sad for you....
RAK/RAK0069540
I think this guy's put on some weight, though.[nl]No, not just him, but all the others, too....
CTG/CTG0017770
Reeeeally?[nl]I never paid too much attention to their size.
RAK/RAK0069550
Yeah....that sounds about right.
RAK/RAK0069560
(It was your fault to begin with! You've just been eyeballing[nl] the food and giving everyone massive portions....!)
CTG/CTG0017780
Righty-o, I guess I'd better go get everyone fed!
RAK/RAK0069570
(But today's gonna be different!)
RAK/RAK0069580
Chitoge! Here, these are for the chickens.
CTG/CTG0017790
Oh, you've got the food separated into little bags?[nl]Must've been a lot of work to do something so small.
RAK/RAK0069590
Not at all. I don't mind a bit,[nl]since this way it's less stressful for me.
CTG/CTG0017800
Is that so? Okay then.[nl]So I give them all of these, right?
RAK/RAK0069600
Yes, yes. Exactly!
CTG/CTG0017810
'K, heeere goooes!
RAK/RAK0069610
(What a great idea, if I do say so myself![nl] Now Chitoge won't overfeed any of the animals!)
CTG/CTG0017820
Alright, done. Now for the crocodiles--
RAK/RAK0069620
Hang on, Chitoge! These are for the crocodiles.
CTG/CTG0017830
Huh? W-What's this?[nl]Don't tell me you've got these portioned out for everyone!?
RAK/RAK0069630
Haha, w-well, sure.
CTG/CTG0017840
Hmmmm. You're very well prepared.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0017850
But I gotta say it's fun to do stuff like this.[nl]It's like we're both working on the same thing.
CTG/CTG0017860
......Uh, wait![nl]It's not like it's fun *specifically* with you!
RAK/RAK0069640
I-I get it, I get it.[nl]I'm just glad you're enjoying this.
CTG/CTG0017870
W-Well....it's alright![nl]Alright!
CTG/CTG0017880
....Okay! Right, who's next to feed?
RAK/RAK0069650
Here ya go. Give that to the goldfish.
CTG/CTG0017890
Okaaaay! I'll be right back!
