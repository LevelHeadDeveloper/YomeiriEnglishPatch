Mmph....there we go. Phew....
RAK/RAK0061580
Shuu, what's with all those boxes?
SYU/SYU0011470
Oh, these? Ms. Kyoko asked me to fetch these for her.[nl]I'm told they're full of documents and stuff.
RAK/RAK0061590
Hmmmm.... I know I get asked to do things a lot,[nl]but Ms. Kyoko's always making you do stuff, too.[nl]Isn't that hard?
SYU/SYU0011480
Haha, I don't really mind.[nl]All those little points I'm earning really add up.
RAK/RAK0061600
Earning points?[nl]Are you trying to get her to raise your test scores?
RAK/RAK0061610
It's not like I don't see where you're going with that,[nl]but even though she seems kinda careless, she's actually[nl]very stringent about this sorta thing. It definitely won't work.
SYU/SYU0011490
Hahaha, maybe you're right.[nl]Well, I'm going to give it a shot either way.
SYU/SYU0011500
Alright, I'm off.
RAK/RAK0061620
Okay.... You need a hand with these?
SYU/SYU0011510
Thank you.[nl]I'd love some help with this.
SYU/SYU0011520
There's no point in doing things like this[nl]if you have to do them alone.
RAK/RAK0061630
....Whaddya mean?
SYU/SYU0011530
Oh, Onodera's behind you.
RAK/RAK0061640
Whaaaat!?

SYU/SYU0011540
Just kidding! ♪[nl]See ya, Raku!
RAK/RAK0061650
....Why would you tell a joke like that!?
