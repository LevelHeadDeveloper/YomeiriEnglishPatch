Well, however you may truly feel....
CTG/CTG0005650
From now on, you and me....[nl]We might have to live on this island together forever.
CTG/CTG0005660
How do you feel about that?[nl]Can you endure it?
Living with you would be....
Tolerable
Intolerable
Rather enjoyable
CTG/CTG0005670
Can you really say that so easily?[nl]I mean, it's not like we'll be playing lovers anymore, right?
CTG/CTG0005680
Even if it's fine now, we'll be seeing each other every hour[nl]of every day, even if we'd rather not....
CTG/CTG0005690
You might stop being fond of me one day, right?
CTG/CTG0005700
I-Is that right....
CTG/CTG0005710
Uh, no. I don't mind.[nl]In fact, it's normal to feel that way.
CTG/CTG0005720
It would be torture to spend every moment of every day[nl]with a girl you don't even like....

Huh? R-Really?
CTG/CTG0005740
That's some surprisingly positive thinking.
CTG/CTG0005750
Couldn't even answer if you tried....huh.[nl]Hehehe. That's just like you.
CTG/CTG0005760
It's okay, you don't have to answer.
