I'm getting kinda hungry....[nl]I always get hungry when I'm walking[nl]in the shopping district. Ahhh, the smell of croquettes....
RAK/RAK0069660
I think, for you, that's not limited to just[nl]walking in the shopping district.

The "Wanko Soba Eating Contest" will be beginning shortly![nl]Please feel free to join us!
CTG/CTG0017920
....Hm?
ANO/ANO0000070
Yes, yes! If you want to participate, hurry![nl]Registration closes soon!
CTG/CTG0017930
....Hey, Raku. What the heck is "wagging soba"?
RAK/RAK0069670
Wagging soba....?
Explain jokingly
Explain seriously
RAK/RAK0069680
Wagging soba is soba that has been made by a[nl]specially-trained dog called a soba dog.
CTG/CTG0017940
Huh!? Is that right!? That sounds amazing!
RAK/RAK0069690
Right? They're so cute, using their little tails to flatten[nl]the noodles, that they're popular with men and women[nl]of all ages.
CTG/CTG0017950
I wanna go see it![nl]Hey, hey, let's go!
RAK/RAK0069700
Pft....Kehehe.....
CTG/CTG0017960
Oh, but is that safe with all the fur?[nl]If some got in, I'm sure there'd be a lot of complaints....
RAK/RAK0069710
Hahahahaha!
CTG/CTG0017970
Hm? What is it, Raku?
RAK/RAK0069720
Just kidding![nl]There's no such thing as dogs making soba noodles![nl]Hahahahaha!
CTG/CTG0017980
Huh!? Y-You tricked me!?
RAK/RAK0069730
Sorry, sorry! It's not "wagging soba", it's "wanko soba".[nl]I just thought it was hilarious that you misheard!
CTG/CTG0017990
....Oho, you've got real balls there.[nl]I think I'll lay you out flatter than a soba noodle.
RAK/RAK0069740
No, no, I'm sorry.[nl]I'll tell you what it really is if you forgive me!
RAK/RAK0069750
No, no! It's not "wagging soba", it's "wanko soba".
RAK/RAK0069760
The name "wanko" refers to the way it's served.[nl]The name comes from the regional dialect of Iwate,[nl]where it was invented.
CTG/CTG0018000
Oh....so that's it.[nl]That was so confusing!
RAK/RAK0069770
....Haha. It is indeed not "wagging soba".
CTG/CTG0018010
Shut up. So. what is "wanko soba"?
RAK/RAK0069780
Wanko soba is a bite-sized amount of soba noodles[nl]dipped in hot soba sauce and served in a bowl.
RAK/RAK0069790
The waiter will keep refilling the bowl with noodles.[nl]And the eaters will compete with each other to see [nl]how many bowls they can eat in a certain time.

CTG/CTG0018020

CTG/CTG0018030
Alriiiight! I got in!
RAK/RAK0069810
....That was fast.
ANO/ANO0000080
Ooh, well put, young lady![nl]So, is there a waiter?
CTG/CTG0018040
A waiter?
ANO/ANO0000090
In this competition, it isn't just on the eater to eat quickly,[nl]but also on the waiter who serves the soba from behind.[nl]You need to participate in a pair.
ANO/ANO0000100
To seize the win, the skill of the waiter is also an [nl]important factor. So it would be nice if you have[nl]someone who works well with you.
CTG/CTG0018050
Hmmmmm, I see.
CTG/CTG0018060
....You.
RAK/RAK0069820
Okay, okay, I'll do it.
CTG/CTG0018070
That's the spirit![nl]I'm counting on you, Raku!
