Raku Ichijo. I have an extremely urgent matter[nl]that I must discuss with you.
RAK/RAK0055810
Hm? What is it?
SSR/SSR0015350
This matter is extremely important and concerns[nl]the life of the Mistress. No one else must know.[nl]And I need you to think about it seriously.
RAK/RAK0055820
H-Her life!? What the heck are you talking about?

SSR/SSR0015360
....Yes. For example, if you were to hide[nl]something here on campus, where would be a good place?
SSR/SSR0015370
I will need a place that's secluded, hard to find,[nl]and spacious. Also, if possible, one place on each floor[nl]would be perfect.
RAK/RAK0055830
Huh....? What does this have to do with Chitoge's life?
SSR/SSR0015380
Everything. This is extremely important.[nl]I won't allow just a random answer.
RAK/RAK0055840
Hmmm, let's see....[nl]A secluded, hard-to-find, spacious place....
Science lab
P.E. storehouse
RAK/RAK0055850
How about one of the science labs?
RAK/RAK0055860
Or a home-ec room, or anywhere that isn't[nl]a regular classroom.
SSR/SSR0015390
Hmmm....but both of those are rooms where fire is handled.[nl]It would be too risky to keep explosives there.
RAK/RAK0055870
It sounded like you just said something about explosives,[nl]Tsugumi.
RAK/RAK0055880
How about the P.E. storehouse?[nl]It's definitely further out of view, and there's plenty of space.

SSR/SSR0015400
I see....that could work.
SSR/SSR0015410
But that's outdoors. If I don't pack it right,[nl]the ammunition might get damp.
RAK/RAK0055890
It sounded like you just said something about ammunition,[nl]Tsugumi.
RAK/RAK0055900
What the hell are you doing, exactly!?
@expose
SSR/SSR0015420
Well, I'm getting ready in case the Mistress is attacked here[nl]at school. I want to make sure that, no matter where I am,[nl]I have access to firearms at a moment's notice.
RAK/RAK0055910
Idiot! Don't bring such dangerous things to school!
RAK/RAK0055920
If something happens to Chitoge,[nl]how about you and I just deal with it?
SSR/SSR0015430
With our bare hands? I should be fine, but you....
RAK/RAK0055930
Ghh![nl]Well, I may not be the most reliable fighter,[nl]but I'm better than nothing!
SSR/SSR0015440
Mhm....that's true.
RAK/RAK0055940
Right?
SSR/SSR0015450
And if push comes to shove,[nl]you can be a shield for the Mistress.
RAK/RAK0055950
....Your thought process is scarier than any enemy.
