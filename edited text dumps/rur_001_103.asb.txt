At any rate, I get that you like cat ears, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0001410
But why Kosaki?
RUR/RUR0001420
I wonder where that passion comes from.
RUR/RUR0001430
Tell me. Ichijo, what are[nl]cat ears to you?

RUR/RUR0001440
W-What is this....[nl]They must be really good for you to say that.
RUR/RUR0001450
Cash, you say....[nl]So this is for something bad after all!
RUR/RUR0001460
I'll bet Maiko's in on this, too!
RUR/RUR0001470
Using Kosaki with cat ears as a pretext....[nl]I cannot allow such foolishness.
RUR/RUR0001480
You can't seem to answer.[nl]I guess you were lying after all.
RUR/RUR0001380
You don't have to hide it.[nl]It's all a conspiracy by Maiko, isn't it?
RUR/RUR0001390
You were planning to make a fortune off of[nl]pictures of Kosaki wearing cat ears, weren't you?
