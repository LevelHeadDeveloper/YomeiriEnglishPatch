Hahh....[nl]It's gotten so cold ever since fall started.[nl]I miss summer.
RAK/RAK0077400
Hey, hey, it's too soon to say that.[nl]Didn't we even go to the beach not that long ago?
@expose
MRK/MRK0014230
Yes, that was quite fun.
MRK/MRK0014240
The sea here in Japan sparkled far more with you, Raku dearest,[nl]than it does in the Maldives, where I usually go.
MRK/MRK0014250
And the barbecue I had with you,[nl]and the fireworks I lit with you....[nl]These are all precious memories to me.
RAK/RAK0077410
Don't just casually leave out everyone else.[nl]Chitoge and the others were there too, right?
MRK/MRK0014260
Oh, were they?
MRK/MRK0014270
That's strange.[nl]Every detail of that day should be etched into my brain[nl]as a glorious summer memory.
@expose
MRK/MRK0014280
I can even remember your gentle touch as you rubbed sunscreen[nl]on me, Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0077420
But I didn't rub sunscreen on you!?
CTG/CTG0023320
You....[nl]If I just sit by and listen, you start saying[nl]all these things!?
MRK/MRK0014290
Oh, were you eavesdropping?
CTG/CTG0023330
The whole classroom can hear you!
CTG/CTG0023340
First of all, you're making Darling sound bad[nl]the way you're talking! You should think about the trouble[nl]you're causing him!
RAK/RAK0077430
Ohh, I never expected you to defend me, Chitoge!
@expose
CTG/CTG0023350
Well, naturally.[nl]I don't want people to think I'd date a player!
RAK/RAK0077440
What, so you were worried for yourself....
MRK/MRK0014300
You're quite self-centered.[nl]I am appalled.
CTG/CTG0023360
Nnnghhh!!

RAK/RAK0077450
Gltbckh!?
CTG/CTG0023370
I'm gonna hit you instead of Marika....
RAK/RAK0077460
Why would you say that *after* you hit me!?
MRK/MRK0014310
Kirisaki really is a very violent person.
MRK/MRK0014320
I, on the other hand, would stick by your side[nl]no matter how much of a bad rap you get.
CTG/CTG0023380
Why do you think he *has* a bad rap in the first place!?[nl]Anyway, stay away from my darling!
MRK/MRK0014330
I'm sorry, but I can't stay away from him[nl]until after you two break up.
RAK/RAK0077470
H-Hey, you two. Don't get so heated....[nl]Or, you know....
WSB/WSB0000250
Look, look! They're fighting again!
WSA/WSA0000260
Ichijo does this a lot.[nl]Rumor has it he's made countless girls cry this way.
RAK/RAK0077480
(Aaargh....[nl] There goes my reputation again....)
@expose
MRK/MRK0014340
Poor Raku dearest.[nl]I'll rub that bruise out of your cheeks for you.
MRK/MRK0014350
Pain, pain, go away!
RAK/RAK0077490
Whaa!? Stop rubbing my cheek!
CTG/CTG0023390
Khh....[nl]I'm right here, you know!
MRK/MRK0014360
Hehehe, are we feeling jealous?[nl]But it's all because of how violent you were, Kirisaki.
@ザクシャ万里花・中
CTG/CTG0023400
Mgghhh![nl]Raku, you remember that, don't you!?
RAK/RAK0077500
Why are you mad at me!?
CTG/CTG0023410
Anyway....[nl]Don't mess around with my darling any more!
MRK/MRK0014370
You're the one who shouldn't mess around with him any more!
@ザクシャ万里花・小
RAK/RAK0077510
(Hahhh....[nl] How many more times am I gonna have to put up[nl] with these exchanges before graduation....?)
