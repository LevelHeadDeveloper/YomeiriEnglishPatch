Hi, Raku! Over here, over here!
RAK/RAK0064390
Am I the last one here?
KSK/KSK0017430
Yes. Ruri and Tachibana left to get some[nl]gifts at the flea market.
@expose
SSR/SSR0020460
I hope you have a present as well. 
RAK/RAK0064400
Wait!? Come to think of it, I couldn't find a good one! 
CTG/CTG0015380
Hmph, I thought that might happen. 
SYU/SYU0012810
Why don't you also head to the flea market?[nl]You might find a real bargain!
RAK/RAK0064410
Okay. I'll hurry! 
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0064420
Hmmm...[nl]Accessories, some toys and games, even books.
RAK/RAK0064430
...I guess I'll play it safe with an accessory.[nl]If a girl gets it, great. If a guy gets it, he can[nl]give it to one of is friends.
RAK/RAK0064440
Ummm... what sort of accessory should I get...?
Ribbon
Necklace
Hair Clip
Earrings
RAK/RAK0064450
...A ribbon, huh?[nl]I bet it would look great on Chitoge.
RAK/RAK0064460
I'm not saying she's likely to get it, but...
RAK/RAK0064470
Okay... I'll get this one!
RAK/RAK0064480
I like this necklace. It has a nice air of maturity.[nl]If Onodera wore something like this,[nl]I'll bet it would look great...
RAK/RAK0064490
Not that she'll necessarily get it, but...
RAK/RAK0064500
Tachibana always has a hair clip kinda like this one.[nl]I bet it would look great on her.
RAK/RAK0064510
Well, that doesn't mean Tachibana will get it, but...
RAK/RAK0064520
For now, I'll buy this one.
RAK/RAK0064530
Oh, these earrings are pretty stylish.[nl]I bet Tsugumi would look great wearing them.
RAK/RAK0064540
I'm not saying she'll necessarily end up with them, but...
RAK/RAK0064550
For now, we'll try this one.
RYU/RYU0001530
Everyone, please be patient![nl]Let's find out who got which gifts!
RYU/RYU0001540
Everyone, please open what you were given!
RAK/RAK0064560
(Hey, I wonder who got my gift?)
CTG/CTG0015390
Waa, this ribbon is adorable!
RAK/RAK0064570
Whoa, Chitoge actually got it!
CTG/CTG0015400
Huh? It says here it's from Raku!?
RAK/RAK0064580
I saw that ribbon and thought it would[nl]look great on you, so I got it.[nl]I didn't think you'd really end up with it.
@ザクシャ千棘・大
CTG/CTG0015410
Hehe, I see. I wasn't supposed to get it.
CTG/CTG0015420
But, I might be happy.[nl]My saying that is a high point for you as a boyfriend.
CTG/CTG0015430
...I'll wear it on one of our dates sometime.[nl]You'll notice when I do, right?
KSK/KSK0017450
Ahhh~, this necklace is beautiful.
RAK/RAK0064590
Whoa!? It seriously ended up with Onodera!?
KSK/KSK0017460
Huh? By any chance, is this present from Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0064600
Uhh, that's right... 
@ザクシャ小咲・大
KSK/KSK0017470
Hehh... It feels so nice and mature.[nl]I love it.
KSK/KSK0017480
But I wonder if it would suit me with how childish I am?
RAK/RAK0064610
Don't talk like that![nl]It suits you better that anyone else here!
KSK/KSK0017490
I-Is that so?
KSK/KSK0017500
....If you say so, I'll believe it. 
KSK/KSK0017510
I'll wear this the next time I go out.[nl]Thank you, Ichijo,
MRK/MRK0011470
Oh my, it's a hair clip. 
RAK/RAK0064620
Oh, wow! I can't believe you actually got it.
MRK/MRK0011480
Ehhh!?[nl]So, this is the present that Raku dearest picked out?
RAK/RAK0064630
It's the one that caught my eye.[nl]I figured it would suit you if you got it, right?
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0011490
So, this means that Raku dearest[nl]has given me a gift...
RAK/RAK0064640
Well, I guess. 
MRK/MRK0011500
A gift, given to me by Raku dearest out of love...
RAK/RAK0064650
Where did that come from!?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0011510
Raku dearest! I'm so happy I could die![nl]I'm so lucky, I'm so happy, I'm so gosh darn happy~~~~!
RAK/RAK0064660
Oh, okay... So you like it.[nl]I'm glad.
MRK/MRK0011520
I'll put this hair clip in a glass case, and then I'll buy an[nl]anti-theft infrared sensor so no one can steal it...
RAK/RAK0064670
N-No, you can just use it normally.[nl]It wasn't that expensive. 
MRK/MRK0011530
But it's something you gave me, Raku dearest.[nl]It's worth more to me than any expensive gift.
SSR/SSR0020470
Hmm... Earrings?[nl]I don't think I've ever worn something like these...
RAK/RAK0064680
Tsugumi actually got them!
SSR/SSR0020480
What!? ...So, this is the present you picked out?
RAK/RAK0064690
That's right.[nl]I thought they would look cool if you wore them,[nl]but I didn't think you'd actually get them!
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0020490
S-Stop trying to flatter me![nl]I wouldn't look that great in earrings.
RAK/RAK0064700
That's not true.[nl]Put it on and go find the guy you like.[nl]He'll probably compliment you.
SSR/SSR0020500
そ、そんなヤツはいない！
RAK/RAK0064710
Hey, why are you yelling?[nl]I'm kinda surprised...
SSR/SSR0020510
Jeez...
SSR/SSR0020520
...Next time, I'll put these earrings on, [nl]so you can see how I look. 
RAK/RAK0064720
Huh...? 
SSR/SSR0020530
It's what you said earlier.[nl]I want to see if you really think they suit me.
RAK/RAK0064730
...Do you actually like them? 
SSR/SSR0020540
S-Shut up![nl]Who could be happy with a present from you!!?
SSR/SSR0020550
I'm not happy with it! I don't like it!! 
RAK/RAK0064740
Right, right... I get it.[nl]You're angry, probably embarrassed...[nl]You're having a hard time.
RAK/RAK0064750
(I'm glad you liked it.)

Is today Sunday...? 
RAK/RAK0067330
I don't really have any errands,[nl]so I'll do some housework...
OTM/OTM0007760
Thou art a pain in the ass.[nl]thou has been so carefree all this time,[nl]and the promised month is almost up.
RAK/RAK0067340
Hmm... Well, what will be will be, right?
OTM/OTM0007780
Take it easy. Jeez.
RAK/RAK0067350
(I was able to do some housework on Sunday.)
