Geh! You....came to visit my school again?
OTM/OTM0006170
Mhm. 'Tis a lively and fun place.
OTM/OTM0006180
And this time, I hath stayed in the art room[nl]the whole time so as not to cause thee trouble.[nl]Is that not splendid?
RAK/RAK0063630
That's very considerate of you,[nl]but what is that you're playing with?

Heheh. ♪[nl]This!

This is....a love umbrella, right? Me and....who's that?[nl]#fs{12}TN: What Otama has drawn are known in Japan as an 'aiaigasa'.[nl]These represent shared umbrellas and are drawn to show love between two people.#fs{}
OTM/OTM0006200
Ah, humans such as thyself cannot read this, huh?[nl]It's read "Otama".
OTM/OTM0006210
I saw this on TV this morning.[nl]Drawing names under an umbrella is a sign[nl]of friendship, right?
OTM/OTM0006220
Raku, O he who bringeth me fried tofu, and I,[nl]O she who eateth it, are best of friends! Hence we are[nl]holding an umbrella together!

Oh, there you are![nl]I've been looking all over for you, Darling!
OTM/OTM0006230
Oh, this isn't good.

Oh, this love umbrella....
RAK/RAK0063660
Uhh, no, this is....
SSR/SSR0020200
"Raku" on one side....and who's this?[nl]I've never seen characters written like these before.
CTG/CTG0015080
Dunno. But the fact that it's written on the other side[nl]means that at least it's a woman. What the hell is[nl]the meaning of this, Darling?
RAK/RAK0063670
W-Well....the thing is, umm....
MRK/MRK0011250
Just who is this nobody?
CTG/CTG0015090
Tell us.
SSR/SSR0020210
Hurry up.
MRK/MRK0011260
Please tell me.
RAK/RAK0063680
It's a misunderstanding![nl]There's no deep meaning to this!
SSR/SSR0020220
Hey, quit lying already![nl]We have the evidence all right here!
MRK/MRK0011270
Kirisaki, Tsugumi, I've called Honda and had her[nl]secure an interrogation chamber for us.[nl]We can talk some more there....

Heh. Good job, Marika.

Better prepare yourself, Darling.[nl]I won't forgive you for cheating on me.
