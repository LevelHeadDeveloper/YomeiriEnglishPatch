Raku dearest! What are you doing here?
RAK/RAK0078100
I heard you had to go to the infirmary,[nl]so I came to visit you.
@expose
MRK/MRK0015120
Well, how about that! I'm glad you came for me!
MRK/MRK0015130
But don't worry.[nl]I'm not as sick as you are worried about me, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0078110
I see. That's good to hear....
RAK/RAK0078120
(....Why is she acting so tough here?)
MRK/MRK0015140
I don't want us to be standing for too long while we talk,[nl]so please sit down. I'll get us some tea.
RAK/RAK0078130
Huh....?
MRK/MRK0015150
I left some tea here the other day, and those[nl]cookies the other students brought as a gift are under the shelf.[nl]Ah, here they are.
RAK/RAK0078140
Hey, don't just take those out without permission.[nl]Won't the nurse get mad?
MRK/MRK0015160
It's fine. She's not the kind of nurse[nl]to get mad over something like this.
MRK/MRK0015170
Oh, come to think of it, she also asked me to[nl]refill the gauze and disinfectant for her! Let's do that now.
RAK/RAK0078150
A give-and-take kind of relationship, huh.
MRK/MRK0015180
The nurse is in a meeting right now and won't be back for a while.[nl]So please, make yourself at home.
RAK/RAK0078160
So this is your house.
MRK/MRK0015190
Hmmm.... Actually, I think I spend the third-most time here,[nl]behind my actual home and the classroom.
MRK/MRK0015200
The nurse told me I could come in whenever I wanted,[nl]regardless of whether or not I'm feeling well.[nl]We usually have a pretty good chat.
RAK/RAK0078170
Wow, sounds like you're getting along great.
MRK/MRK0015210
Yes. She's quite the kind and wonderful nurse.
RAK/RAK0078180
(It's rare to hear Tachibana talk this way about someone.)
RAK/RAK0078190
(Gotta say I'm surprised....[nl] But it looks like she interacts with people other than us,[nl] which is a bit of a relief.)
MRK/MRK0015220
Of course, Raku dearest, we never talk about[nl]anything but you, so don't worry. ♪
@ザクシャ万里花・中
RAK/RAK0078200
....The nurse has it rough.
MRK/MRK0015230
Oh, Raku dearest. If you look closely,[nl]wouldn't you say your face looks a bit pale?
RAK/RAK0078210
Huh, really?[nl]I'd say I feel just fine....
MRK/MRK0015240
No, my eyes never lie![nl]There is nothing pertaining to my darling Raku[nl]that slips past my eyes!
RAK/RAK0078220
Ahhh, I see....
MRK/MRK0015250
So please, drink this.
RAK/RAK0078230
What's this? Medicine?
MRK/MRK0015260
Just a little supplement.[nl]There's nothing weird in it.
RAK/RAK0078240
I guess I'll take it, if you insist.
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0015270
Yes, it's white broth.
RAK/RAK0078250
Ohh, very well prepared.
RAK/RAK0078260
Oh? I suddenly feel like I'm getting better.
MRK/MRK0015280
Hehehe, it's quite the special supplement.
