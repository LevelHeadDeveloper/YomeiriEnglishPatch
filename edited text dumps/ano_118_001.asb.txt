Hm? ....It's from Chitoge.[nl]What does she want?
CTG/CTG0015120
Hello, Raku? Where are you right now?
RAK/RAK0063710
Still at school. Just thinking about[nl]whether to go straight home or stop somewhere on the way.
CTG/CTG0015130
I see.... I guess that's just as well.
CTG/CTG0015140
Lately, Claude's been real suspicious about where you go.[nl]You'd better be careful if you're gonna stop somewhere.
RAK/RAK0063720
Huh? Really?
CTG/CTG0015150
Yep. He's got everyone from the Beehive gathered today,[nl]and they're probably watching you.
CTG/CTG0015160
I'm warning you, just as your girlfriend, be careful[nl]if you go talk to someone! Um....especially if it's a girl[nl]other than me!
CTG/CTG0015170
I-I don't personally care either way, but Claude and the[nl]others do tend to jump to conclusions a lot.[nl]But I don't care who you talk to, Raku!
RAK/RAK0063730
O-Okay....got it. Are you angry about something?
CTG/CTG0015180
I'm not angry!
RAK/RAK0063740
She's definitely angry....
........
RAK/RAK0063750
....There he is.
RAK/RAK0063760
Gahh.... If this keeps up, I won't be able to[nl]even talk to anyone but Chitoge, am I!?
RAK/RAK0063770
I'll either need to get rid of Claude somehow,[nl]or just head home....
Head home
Don't let Claude win!
RAK/RAK0063780
Well, there's no reason for me to go out of my way[nl]to be suspected. I'll just go home quietly today....

(My life is my own to live.[nl] And I won't let anyone stand in my way!)
RAK/RAK0063800
(....So, who should I go talk to?)
Chitoge!
Onodera!
Tsugumi!
Tachibana!
