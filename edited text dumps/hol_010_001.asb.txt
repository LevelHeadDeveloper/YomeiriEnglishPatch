Oh, I'm sorry.[nl]The young master was even doing laundry....
RAK/RAK0066210
We're a big family.[nl]I depend on you guys to feed me[nl]so you can depend on me to do this housework.
RAK/RAK0066220
Besides, you guys do everything during the week.[nl]Let me help you with the cooking, cleaning[nl]and laundry today.
RYU/RYU0001620
Mh... Young master.[nl]What a fine man you've grown up to be![nl]I guess I raised you right after all!
RYU/RYU0001630
You're a bit of a weak fighter, but when it comes[nl]to pure manliness, you're the best in all of Japan![nl]No, the whole world!
RAK/RAK0066230
That's hardly a nice compliment...

Young master, what do you think of these seasonings?[nl]It's a combination I saw on TV a while back.[nl]A popular chef was using them...  
RAK/RAK0066240
Ohh! This is delicious![nl]You have to tell me what this is!
RYU/RYU0001650
Of course![nl]It should be pretty easy to show you while[nl]we make lunch.
RAK/RAK0066250
By the way, I made some inari sushi using a new method[nl]I invented. You should try it.
RYU/RYU0001660
Ehh... Young master, you've been making a lot[nl]of that fried tofu stuff lately, right?[nl]The stuff they offer at that one inari shrine...  
RAK/RAK0066260
Well, because there's someone nearby who keeps[nl]pestering me for food.
RYU/RYU0001670
Phew... You have strange friends.

RYU/RYU0001680
Phew... I've finished cleaning the bathroom.
RAK/RAK0066270
I'm tired as hell from all that housework,[nl]I guess I'm just not used to it.[nl]May I take a bath first?
RYU/RYU0001690
Oh, of course!
RYU/RYU0001700
Then, as the young head of the Shuei-gumi, allow me[nl]to be so presumptuous as to wash your backside!
RAK/RAK0066280
No thanks![nl]You're really embarassing me!
RAK/RAK0066290
Oh, I've finished prepping dinner, and I've got everyone's[nl]favorite sake chilled, so I'll leave the rest to you, Ryuu.
RYU/RYU0001710
Y-Young master![nl]What a capable young man!
RYU/RYU0001720
You'll make a great son-in-law to someone, kid![nl]I guarantee it!
RAK/RAK0066300
Hehe, stop it. You're embarassing me.

Raku... I thinketh that thou must try harder to[nl]just enjoy thy high-school years....
OTM/OTM0007290
I fear for thy future if things continue like this.
