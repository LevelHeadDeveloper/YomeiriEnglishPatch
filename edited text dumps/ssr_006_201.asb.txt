SSR/SSR0008220
Still having trouble, huh?
RAK/RAK0020290
Of course.[nl]This is the first time I've done anything like this.
RAK/RAK0020300
I don't know what the right thing to do is.[nl]I don't know where to find the right answer....
SSR/SSR0008230
....Then, why don't we both look for it?
RAK/RAK0020310
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0008240
I don't know what your problem is, yet....[nl]But it won't bother me if you confide in me.
SSR/SSR0008250
If it's a really serious problem, and you can't even[nl]tell Chitoge or Onodera or anyone else---
SSR/SSR0008260
Then I'll accept all of it.
SSR/SSR0008270
I'll worry about it with you and help you.
RAK/RAK0020320
....Idiot.
SSR/SSR0008280
Hey, don't make fun of me![nl]I was being serious about that!
RAK/RAK0020330
Heh....you're a really funny guy.
SSR/SSR0008290
Stop laughing. I think I just[nl]said something really embarassing....
RAK/RAK0020340
Totally. You blurt out these embarrassing things[nl]in front of me. You're an absolute fool, you know that?
RAK/RAK0020350
You're stupid and dumb and weak and naive....[nl]And also incredibly insensitive.
SSR/SSR0008300
That's mean.[nl]You didn't need to go that far.
RAK/RAK0020360
But thanks to you, I have my answer.
SSR/SSR0008310
RAK/RAK0020370
I---
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0008320
I like you.
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0020380
....Huh?
SSR/SSR0008330
Whether or not you're the mistress's boyfriend,[nl]these feelings won't change.
SSR/SSR0008340
I want to be near you more.
SSR/SSR0008350
I want you to know all about me.[nl]And I want to know all about you, too.
SSR/SSR0008360
And....I want to love you more.
SSR/SSR0008370
This is my first love.
RAK/RAK0020390
....
@expose
SSR/SSR0008380
And just like that, we're back in the right bodies.
RAK/RAK0020400
Why all of a sudden....?
SSR/SSR0008390
I'm sure it's because I properly voiced my feelings.[nl]Because that was my true wish.
RAK/RAK0020410
What, is that so....?
SSR/SSR0008400
Your face is bright red, Raku Ichijo.[nl]That face is making me embarrassed, too.
RAK/RAK0020420
I-I can't help it![nl]I wasn't expecting a sudden love confession!
SSR/SSR0008410
Does that mean....it was a nuisance?
RAK/RAK0020430
That's not what I meant![nl]It was....just so sudden, my mind went blank....
RAK/RAK0020440
I still don't quite understand it....
SSR/SSR0008420
Then, shall I tell you again?
RAK/RAK0020450
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0008430
You'll accept all of it, won't you?
SSR/SSR0008440
I'll say it again and again until you understand.[nl]I....
SSR/SSR0008450
Raku Ichijo, I.....

Don't move! Raku Ichijooooooo!!!!
RAK/RAK0020470
Waagh!?
SSR/SSR0008460
Master Claude!?
CLD/CLD0000830
No....NO, NO, NO!!!!!
CLD/CLD0000840
I won't allow it, Raku Ichijo! It's bad enough you have[nl]Mistress Chitoge in your thrall, but to put your[nl]slimy hands on Seishiro as well....! 
RAK/RAK0020480
H-H-Hang on! How long have you been watching!?
CLD/CLD0000850
Shut up! What kind of vendetta do you have against me!?
RAK/RAK0020490
I don't have one!
SSR/SSR0008470
Please wait, Master Claude![nl]This was my fault, not Raku Ichijo's!
CLD/CLD0000860
Seishiro....
CLD/CLD0000870
I'm sorry.
SSR/SSR0008480
Huh?
CLD/CLD0000880
For many years, I've been mistaken.
CLD/CLD0000890
The ribbon on your head....[nl]And also the way you've been talking and acting....[nl]I finally understand what it all means.
CLD/CLD0000900
Heh....I'm surprised at myself for being so obtuse.[nl]I must apologize to you.
SSR/SSR0008490
Master Claude....
CLD/CLD0000910
But, it's still displeasing.
SSR/SSR0008500
!
CLD/CLD0000920
You....couldn't possibly be in love with this guy?
SSR/SSR0008510
----
SSR/SSR0008520
....Yes.
CLD/CLD0000930
That path would prove difficult.[nl]You can never be united with Raku Ichijo.
SSR/SSR0008530
I understand that. In thinking of the mistress,[nl]I have kept my feelings hidden for a long time.
SSR/SSR0008540
However! I still love this man!
RAK/RAK0020500
Tsugumi....
RAK/RAK0020510
H-Hey....Claude?
CLD/CLD0000940
Heh....
CLD/CLD0000950
Heh....hehe....heh....
CLD/CLD0000960
Raku Ichijo. I don't know what kind of trick[nl]you used to possess Seishiro like this....
CLD/CLD0000970
I was a fool for letting it go[nl]all this time just because you were the mistress's lover.
CLD/CLD0000980
I will not be satisfied until I make you[nl]suffer worse than death.
RAK/RAK0020520
Eeeeeeeeh!?[nl]D-Do you think it's my fault!?
CLD/CLD0000990
Never cross the Beehive, punk....!
SSR/SSR0008550
No! Move, Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0020530
Huh....?

RAK/RAK0020550
T-Tsugumi!! You saved me!?
SSR/SSR0008580
Ghh....Don't be an idiot![nl]You're not strong enough to withstand a[nl]blow from Master Claude!
CLD/CLD0001010
Get out of the way, Seishiro. Do you want to die!?
CLD/CLD0001020
This man is our enemy. For the mistress's sake,[nl]and for your sake, he must be eliminated.
SSR/SSR0008590
I don't want to....!
CLD/CLD0001030
What....?
SSR/SSR0008600
I consider both the mistress and Raku Ichijo to be very [nl]important to me! Whether or not you agree,[nl]that's non-negotiable!
SSR/SSR0008610
So, to protect this man, I'll--
SSR/SSR0008620
I'll....even fight you!
RAK/RAK0020560
CLD/CLD0001040
Do you really think you can take me alone?
SSR/SSR0008630
----!
CLD/CLD0001050
Who was it who taught you to fight?[nl]Who taught you unarmed combat?
SSR/SSR0008640
Ghh....!!
CLD/CLD0001060
Have you ever, even once, been able to defeat me?
CLD/CLD0001070
I have never trained you to misjudge[nl]a difference in strength....
CLD/CLD0001080
Still, if you're going to challenge me--
@expose2
CLD/CLD0001090
Then I won't hold anything back!
SSR/SSR0008650
Ghh....[nl]I didn't know that Master Claude was so terrifying when [nl]he's serious....just standing in front of him, my legs--
RAK/RAK0020570
H-Hey! You're shaking!
SSR/SSR0008660
S-Shut up! I know that!
SSR/SSR0008670
You run away. I'll stop Master Claude.
CLD/CLD0001100
You stand firm in your convictions.
CLD/CLD0001110
But, you know what happens to traitors....[nl]Don't you?
SSR/SSR0008680
......!
CLD/CLD0001120
I will discipline you severely....
SSR/SSR0008690
Khhhh....!
RAK/RAK0020580
(Dammit....why the hell am I just[nl] letting Tsugumi protect me!?
RAK/RAK0020590
SSR/SSR0008700
Waaagh!?
RAK/RAK0020600
Get it together, Tsugumi!
SSR/SSR0008710
Y-You! Why are you holding my hand!?
RAK/RAK0020610
If you're so scared that you're shaking,[nl]then you should just stay quiet from the start.
RAK/RAK0020620
I'm not so pathetic as to just[nl]let you protect me.
SSR/SSR0008730
Y-You idiot, get the hell outta here![nl]This is no time to play it cool!
RAK/RAK0020630
....I can't wimp out in front of someone[nl]who says she likes me.
CLD/CLD0001130
Raku Ichijo![nl]What are you doing to Seishiro in front of me!?
RAK/RAK0020640
Shut up! As for you, Claude!
RAK/RAK0020650
Tsugumi's a child you raised![nl]A parent shouldn't be treating their child like this!
SSR/SSR0008740
Raku Ichijo....
CLD/CLD0001140
Tch.... You smartass!
CLD/CLD0001150
This is your last warning. Seishiro.[nl]Hand him over, now.
CLD/CLD0001160
If you don't, he won't just sink to the bottom of the sea....
CLD/CLD0001170
I will tear off that frail body with my own hands!
RAK/RAK0020660
(Oogh....he's scary!)
RAK/RAK0020670
(I was trying to be strong,[nl] but what am I doing now!?)
SSR/SSR0008750
Good grief....now you're the one shaking, aren't you?
SSR/SSR0008760
You should've left me alone and run away....
RAK/RAK0020680
S-Shut up. I can't back down[nl]now that I've said all that.
@ＢＧＭ停止
SSR/SSR0008770
Then why don't you fight with me?
RAK/RAK0020690
SSR/SSR0008780
I don't know what I can do against[nl]Master Claude when he's serious....
SSR/SSR0008790
But, strangely, you're calming my heart by holding my hand.[nl]I can feel my strength welling up.
@expose
SSR/SSR0008800
So, then....will you keep holding my hand, please?
RAK/RAK0020700
SSR/SSR0008810
Please....Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0020710
Alright. Well then, let's go together!
SSR/SSR0008820
Right!
CLD/CLD0001180
DIE, RAKU ICHIJO!
SSR/SSR0008830
Let's go, Raku Ichijo![nl]Match my timing!
RAK/RAK0020720
Right....!
CLD/CLD0001190
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!

RAK/RAK0020730
Whoa, we're kinda alright.
CLD/CLD0001210
What!?
CLD/CLD0001220
Stupid....! You're unharmed!?
SSR/SSR0008840
Look sharp. The next one's coming.
RAK/RAK0020740
Right!
CLD/CLD0001230
Heh, you got lucky. You can't dodge like that every time!
CLD/CLD0001240
CLD/CLD0001250
HAAAAHHH!!
CLD/CLD0001260
TCHAAAAAAHHH!
CLD/CLD0001270
Why!? Why do I keep missing!?
RAK/RAK0020750
(It's strange....even though I'm just holding her hand....)
RAK/RAK0020760
(I always know....how she'll move next....)
CLD/CLD0001280
Dammit, Seishiro! How are you moving so fast[nl]with that punk weighing you down!?
SSR/SSR0008850
Weighing me down!? Not at all!
RAK/RAK0020770
(To the right!)
SSR/SSR0008860
We're matching each other's moves perfectly now!
RAK/RAK0020780
(Left!)
SSR/SSR0008870
I can't get this kind of power by myself![nl]It's courage I'm getting from fighting with the man I love!
SSR/SSR0008880
This is the only technique that can surpass you!
CLD/CLD0001290
Gwlbck!
SSR/SSR0008890
Now! We'll knock him down, Raku Ichijo!

CLD/CLD0001340
Gack...! Stupid....[nl]How could....I....lose...!?
SSR/SSR0008960
I'm sorry, Master Claude.
SSR/SSR0008970
Even you cannot stop my feelings---!
CLD/CLD0001350
Gack....I never thought you'd be so powerful, Seishiro.[nl]As expected of the agent I raised myself.
CLD/CLD0001360
And....this would be what you call the power of love....
SSR/SSR0008980
I'm sorry....
CLD/CLD0001370
Regrettably, I've lost.
CLD/CLD0001380
But....I'll tell you this, Seishiro and Raku Ichijo.
CLD/CLD0001390
Don't do anything that will make Mistress Chitoge sad.
CLD/CLD0001400
Please....promise me that much.
SSR/SSR0008990
Sure. I understand.[nl]After all, I love the mistress, too.
CLD/CLD0001410
Heh....then do as you please.[nl]I have nothing to say....
SSR/SSR0009000
Thank you, Master Claude.
RAK/RAK0020860
(Good grief.... Well, I guess that settles that, doesn't it?)
CLD/CLD0001420
But, I must say I'm surprised....
CLD/CLD0001430
I didn't think you and the punk were...."that kind" of people.
RAK/RAK0020870
SSR/SSR0009010
T-That kind?
CLD/CLD0001440
I didn't think you could "play for both teams"....[nl]At the very least, I was expecting a [nl]friendship between men....
SSR/SSR0009020
Ee-eh-....[nl]N-No, Master Claude!
@キャラ揺らし
CLD/CLD0001450

H-Hey! What did you mean by "that kind"?
RAK/RAK0020890
Hey, come on! Don't pass out![nl]Wake up! Wake up and listen to me!
SSR/SSR0009030
This guy....he still thinks I'm a man[nl]after all this time....
RAK/RAK0020900
I'm begging you, wake up![nl]We can't just stop heeeeere!
@フェードアウト
CLD/CLD0001460
Hello.
RAK/RAK0020910
Gah! Claude!
CLD/CLD0001470
Oh, wouldn't you be Raku Ichijo,[nl]the young master of the Shuei-Gumi?
RAK/RAK0020920
Y-Yeah....
CLD/CLD0001480
Well, you have a date with the mistress today?[nl]After all, you are her lover.
RAK/RAK0020930
Huh?
CLD/CLD0001490
Well, so far![nl]We don't know how long that relationship will last, right?[nl]Hahahahahaha!
CLD/CLD0001500
Anyway, I had a strange dream last night.
RAK/RAK0020940
D-Dream?
CLD/CLD0001510
Yes. A dream in which the young master[nl]and Seishiro were in a forbidden love.
CLD/CLD0001520
Well, it was a blood-curdling scenario![nl]A truly absurd dream!
CLD/CLD0001530
But, you mustn't worry.
CLD/CLD0001540
Because then I, Claude, appeared, defeated the [nl]young master, and saved both the mistress and Seishiro!
CLD/CLD0001550
If that had been real life, you wouldn't be here![nl]Consider your life saved, young master!
RAK/RAK0020950
O-Okay....[nl]I'm glad it was only a dream.
CLD/CLD0001560
Well, I have an assignment, so I'll be going now.
CLD/CLD0001570
....Ah. That's right.[nl]I should probably call the mistress as well.
CLD/CLD0001580
Tch.
RAK/RAK0020970
(Does he think everything[nl] that happened yesterday was part of his dream?)
RAK/RAK0020980
(It's an awfully convenient dream,[nl] but, well, I guess it helps me....)
RAK/RAK0020990
(But....what should I do about Tsugumi?)
RAK/RAK0021000
(After the fight, we were too busy carrying Claude[nl]to talk about anything, and it was all a mess....)
CTG/CTG0008980
Hello, darling! Thanks for picking me up!
RAK/RAK0021010
Yo, honey.
RAK/RAK0021020
A-And....Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0009040
What is it? Is my presence here a problem?
RAK/RAK0021030
No, not really....
SSR/SSR0009050
Don't worry, I'm just here to see you off.[nl]You should focus on escorting the mistress.
RAK/RAK0021040
RAK/RAK0021050
(What's with her? She's just acting completely normal,[nl] like she never confessed her love!)
CTG/CTG0008990
Ah....sorry![nl]I think I left something in my room!
CTG/CTG0009000
Tsugumi! Sorry, but you'll have to stay[nl]with my darling for a bit!
SSR/SSR0009060
Yes, I understand.
SSR/SSR0009070
Well, what is it?[nl]You shouldn't stare like that.
RAK/RAK0021060
Well....after everything that happened,[nl]you're acting very normal.
SSR/SSR0009080
Your face has been red for a while now.[nl]You'd better not let the mistress see that.
RAK/RAK0021070
Huh!? Seriously!?
SSR/SSR0009090
Heh....gotcha, idiot.
RAK/RAK0021080
You tricked me!?
SSR/SSR0009100
Don't get so angry. If you're a man,[nl]just grin and bear it.
RAK/RAK0021090
You've been blushing for a while now, too.
SSR/SSR0009110
Wha-? You idiot!?
RAK/RAK0021100
Kidding.
@expose2
SSR/SSR0009120
Sounds to me like you want to die, Raku Ichijo.....
RAK/RAK0021110
You're the one who told me to grin and bear it!
SSR/SSR0009130
I said "if you're a man"![nl]You oaf! You numbskulled man!
RAK/RAK0021120
Dammit....you haven't changed at all, have you?
RAK/RAK0021130
I was just thinking, I need to respond to your feelings....[nl]I was really stressing about it.
SSR/SSR0009140
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0021140
I mean, that's what I should do, right?[nl]It wouldn't be right to just leave this[nl]up in the air after you were so earnest.
SSR/SSR0009150
I-I see.
SSR/SSR0009160
....I'm very glad you feel that way.
RAK/RAK0021150
So, let me set it straight.[nl]I'm going to answer you.
RAK/RAK0021160

RAK/RAK0021170
!?!?
SSR/SSR0009170
....No, not yet.
RAK/RAK0021180
Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0009180
I love both Mistress Chitoge and you, Raku Ichijo.[nl]I'm just glad I was able to make that clear.
SSR/SSR0009190
So....
SSR/SSR0009200
I don't need an answer just yet.
RAK/RAK0021190
....Are you sure?
SSR/SSR0009210
Yes. But be on your guard.
SSR/SSR0009220
I won't be satisfied with just you or the mistress.
SSR/SSR0009230
One day, I'll bring you down[nl]and we'll be inseparable.
RAK/RAK0021200
!!
CTG/CTG0009010
Thank you for waiting!
CTG/CTG0009020
Huh? What's the matter, darling?[nl]Your face looks like a boiled octopus.
RAK/RAK0021210
N-Nothing at all![nl]Come on, let's go!
CTG/CTG0009030
Ah, hang on a sec!
CTG/CTG0009040
Well, we're off, Tsugumi!
SSR/SSR0009240
Yes....have a good time, mistress.[nl]And you too, Raku Ichijo.
SSR/SSR0009250

CLD/CLD0001640
You shut your mouth!
RAK/RAK0021300

CLD/CLD0001650
Seishiro. I'm sending you to America.
SSR/SSR0009370
A-America!?
CLD/CLD0001660
It's a long mission, a very dangerous operation.[nl]I can't do it without you. I'm counting on you!
SSR/SSR0009380
H-Hang on a second! I'm actually not Seishiro, I--
CLD/CLD0001670
What kind of nonsense is that!?[nl]I've already arranged the flight, so come on!
SSR/SSR0009390

R-Raku Ichijo!
CLD/CLD0001680
The mission is an all-out war against "The Bloody Mother",[nl]an extremely violent criminal group that's the second most[nl]dangerous in the country. Ask for more details there.

Come on, lower yourself more![nl]Do you want to die!?
SSR/SSR0009440
W-Why the hell am I in this mess!?
RAK/RAK0021340
Stop whining! Why do you think I[nl]sneaked over as your support!?
SSR/SSR0009450
Crap....I wanted to live an honest life[nl]as a civil servant!
RAK/RAK0021350
It can't be helped now. You're me and I'm you.
RAK/RAK0021360
Until our bodies are returned to normal,[nl]our lives are intertwined....
RAK/RAK0021370
We'll have to be together forever!
SSR/SSR0009460
What the hell, are you enjoying this?
RAK/RAK0021380
N-No way, idiot![nl]See, it's not safe to be distracted!
SSR/SSR0009470

Dang it! If I'd chosen my words more carefully,[nl]I might've been able to hear her wish....
SSR/SSR0009490
I'm such an idiot!!
