Keep Ruri's interest!
RUR/RUR0003330
So, what do you want to talk about?
What do you want to talk about?
Hobbies
RUR/RUR0003470
You should at least answer me.
Love
Studying
@rur_004_101_study
@expose
RUR/RUR0003340
Studying?
RUR/RUR0003350
Well, I am making slightly better grades than you,[nl]but I don't think I could tell you anything really useful....
RUR/RUR0003360
But you still want to ask me something?
What do you  ask?
What's your typical study method?
Does wearing glasses make you smarter?
RUR/RUR0003370
I pay attention in class and[nl]review the lessons....something like that.
RUR/RUR0003380
Well, I guess that was pretty obvious.[nl]Sorry for the boring answer.
Ask more?
How do I get better grades?
Tell me your secret trick
@ザクシャるり・１
RUR/RUR0003390
You've got lots of friends with good grades,[nl]so why not ask one of them to teach you?
RUR/RUR0003400
Like Chitoge, or Tsugumi....
RUR/RUR0003410
Huh....me? Well, I could help you with[nl]ancient literature and Chinese literature.
RUR/RUR0003420
I'm surprised you're so ambitious, Ichijo.[nl]A little impressed, even.
RUR/RUR0003430
Secret tricks, huh....[nl]You sound like an elementary school student, saying that.
RUR/RUR0003440
There are no shortcuts in learning.[nl]You can't get good grades by taking the easy way out.
RUR/RUR0003450
In the end, you'll need to study hard.
RUR/RUR0003480
They do not....is what I'd like to say,[nl]but they do make you look intelligent.
RUR/RUR0003490
Frankly, I think you'd look good with glasses.[nl]And there's quite some demand for men with glasses, right?
RUR/RUR0003500
Why not try wearing some fake glasses?
Try wearing glasses?
Sounds interesting!
I'm not interested.
@ザクシャるり・１
RUR/RUR0003510
Ichijo's debut as a glasses boy, huh....
RUR/RUR0003520
I wonder how Kosaki would react[nl]if I told her.
RUR/RUR0003530
Oh, here, this is what I was talking about.[nl]Hehehe....
RUR/RUR0003540
Ah, yes....[nl]I thought they'd look good on you.
RUR/RUR0003550
Well, you can't say wearing glasses *actually*[nl]makes you intelligent.
RUR/RUR0003560
I mean, the man holed up in the restroom[nl]right now is a pretty good example.
@rur_004_101_love
@expose
RUR/RUR0003660
It's rare that you'd bring up[nl]such a topic, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0003670
What on earth would you want to know?
Ask what about love?
I have a crush on someone....
What's your love life like?
RUR/RUR0003680
Hmmmmm.....I see.
RUR/RUR0003690
....Oh, sorry.[nl]That kind of surprised me.
RUR/RUR0003700
There's only one thing I can tell you.
RUR/RUR0003710
Ichijo, if you like someone,[nl]go tell her right now.
Confess your feelings?
I will, eventually.
That's impossible.
RUR/RUR0003720
I suppose it's a matter of courage and timing.
RUR/RUR0003730
But I'm sure they're looking forward[nl]to your confession.
RUR/RUR0003740
Well, that's my hunch, anyway.
RUR/RUR0003750
You're chicken, Ichijo,[nl]giving up before the fight even starts.
RUR/RUR0003760
Jeez, you're just like her.[nl]It's so frustrating to watch.
RUR/RUR0003770
Are you going to keep quiet like that,[nl]even in front of her? You can't convey your feelings to her.
RUR/RUR0003780
I'm sorry,[nl]but I don't have anything to tell you.
RUR/RUR0003790
I'm not really interested in love to begin with.
Not interested in love?
What a waste of time
That's your choice
RUR/RUR0003800
Does that mean I should be in love too?
RUR/RUR0003810
Frankly, when you say that, it sounds like[nl]you're making it out to be a big deal.
RUR/RUR0003820
Right now, there's no one I know that[nl]I can fall in love with. Unfortunately.
RUR/RUR0003830
Exactly. I appreciate you putting it that way.
RUR/RUR0003840
I've got my hands full enough just looking[nl]at other people's love lives.
RUR/RUR0003850
I'll just wait patiently for the day[nl]that I'm ready for a relationship.
RUR/RUR0003860
Why so quiet all of a sudden?
@rur_004_101_hobby
RUR/RUR0003870
Come to think of it, you and I haven't talked much[nl]about our hobbies, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0003880
For starters, do you even know[nl]what my hobbies are?
Do you know?
Eating
Swimming
Reading
RUR/RUR0003890
Well, that's one of my hobbies.[nl]That's why I came to eat cake here.
RUR/RUR0003900
By the way, I can eat all the sweets I want, no problem.[nl]Stuff like giant pudding.
Giant pudding!?
That can't be good for you
Chitoge said something similar....
RUR/RUR0003910
Don't worry.[nl]I'm getting lots of exercise in my club, and that helps.
RUR/RUR0003920
Well, the main problem is that sweets cost money.
RUR/RUR0003930
Unless, of course,[nl]I have a wallet, like today.
RUR/RUR0003940
Chitoge does eat a lot, doesn't she.
RUR/RUR0003950
I'd like to bring her next time,[nl]as well as Kosaki.
RUR/RUR0003960
Don't worry. I won't make you pay[nl]for next time.
RUR/RUR0003970
Hang on just a second.[nl]There's no reason to be struck speechless.
RUR/RUR0003980
Yes. After all, I'm on the team,[nl]and swimming is one of my favorite things to do.
RUR/RUR0003990
Thanks for your help the other day, by the way.[nl]Even if you did have ulterior motives....
With regards to that....
I'm sorry about that
If you'd let me take a photo....
RUR/RUR0004000
Don't worry about it.[nl]I've had my cake and eaten it, too.
RUR/RUR0004010
Besides, thanks to everyone who showed up,[nl]I got a lot of practice in.
RUR/RUR0004020
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me out again in the future.[nl]Sans cameras, of course.
RUR/RUR0004030
Of course I won't.[nl]Have you no remorse?
RUR/RUR0004040
You'd better be sorry for that[nl]or I'll buy all the cakes in the shop.
RUR/RUR0004050
I'm glad to see you're feeling sorry for yourself.
RUR/RUR0004060
Well, now that you ask....[nl]I have been reading a lot of books.
RUR/RUR0004070
I wasn't aware of it myself....[nl]but I guess it's a hobby.
RUR/RUR0004080
Ichijo, do you read books?
Do you read books?
If they're related to[nl]my hobbies
I don't read much
RUR/RUR0004090
Your hobbies are taking care of animals[nl]and cooking, right?
RUR/RUR0004100
Kosaki told me you have a degree[nl]of expertise with those.
RUR/RUR0004110
I guess you could say I'm a bit obsessive[nl]when it comes to my hobbies.[nl]It's good to have something to devote myself to.
RUR/RUR0004120
Ah, okay.[nl]Why not read this romance novel sometime?
RUR/RUR0004130
Maybe, you can use one of the wittier lines.
RUR/RUR0004140
You don't seem interested.
RUR/RUR0004150
You start a conversation and say nothing?[nl]That's not very nice.
@rur_004_101_timeout
RUR/RUR0003460
You haven't said anything,[nl]does that mean we're done with this topic?
RUR/RUR0003470
You should at least reply.
@rur_004_101_check
RUR/RUR0004170
Phew....
RUR/RUR0004180
You know, talking with you like this sometimes[nl]isn't so bad, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0004190
It was surprisingly fun.
@ザクシャるり・中
@expose2
RUR/RUR0004200
Hahh....
RUR/RUR0004210
Hey, Ichijo.[nl]How much longer is this unproductive discussion?
RUR/RUR0004220
Can we just focus on eating right now?
RUR/RUR0004160
So, is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
