I'd like to share my findings[nl]as someone who's always worn glasses.
RUR/RUR0006260
Glasses are an excellent item that give you[nl]an air of intelligence just by wearing them.
RUR/RUR0006270
Everyone looks intelligent. What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
Outward appearance[nl]means nothing
Does Shuu look intelligent?
They make you look gloomy
RUR/RUR0006280
Oh. Well, the appearance can be a start.
RUR/RUR0006290
It's not even a big problem, really,[nl]it's just a change in appearance.
RUR/RUR0006300
And that isn't even the only advantage of glasses.

Mgh.....That's true,[nl]it would be a stretch to say Maiko looks intelligent....
RUR/RUR0006320
W-Well, there are people who don't look intelligent[nl]even with glasses. I'll admit that.
RUR/RUR0006330
But that's not the only advantage of glasses.
RUR/RUR0006340
You're just prejudiced.[nl]Your perception of glasses is incorrect.
RUR/RUR0006350
And even if that was true....
RUR/RUR0006360
In a world where everyone wears glasses,[nl]that isn't even an issue.
RUR/RUR0006370
If you can't answer the question,[nl]then there's no issue, right?
