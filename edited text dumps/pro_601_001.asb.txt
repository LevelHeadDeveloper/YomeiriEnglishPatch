(...Hmm? Where's Claude?[nl]Did he have some kind of urgent business?)
RAK/RAK0034960
(Whatever. Let's get the hell home.)                   
@フェードアウト500
RAK/RAK0034970
Fwah~, another exhausting day.
RAK/RAK0034980
(But why the hell did Claude come inside the school[nl]today...? Usually, he just sits on a tree or something[nl]and watches us with binoculars.)                            
RAK/RAK0034990
(That's pretty weird, but...)                  
@フェードアウト1000
RAK/RAK0035000
I'm ho--
CLD/CLD0001770
Welcome back.   
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0035010
Gwahhhhh-!!!!                      
CLD/CLD0001780
Jeez. You're a cold bastard, running away like that.   
RAK/RAK0035020
C-C-Claude![nl]Why the hell are you here!?                              
CLD/CLD0001790
Hmm? Claude? 
CLD/CLD0001800
Oh, yeah. I forgot to change back. One sec.

RAK/RAK0035030
Huh? You're Otama!?[nl]Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!?!?                         
OTM/OTM0003300
Thou were not believing what I was telling thee,[nl]so I picked some dork at random near the school[nl]and changed form to scare thee.                                    
@expose
OTM/OTM0003310
How's that? Cool, right?
RAK/RAK0035040
Cool.... what, who....[nl]I'm so surprised, I don't know what to say...                      
RAK/RAK0035050
You... really aren't human, are you...
OTM/OTM0003320
So thou finally believest.[nl]Boy, thou sure took thy time.
RAK/RAK0035060
I believe it all right, but....[nl]...Why are you at my house, exactly?
OTM/OTM0003330
Mhm. There's something here I want.
OTM/OTM0003340
I shall be living here for around a month,[nl]starting today, mkay?
RAK/RAK0035070
Huh...?
OTM/OTM0003360
Thy inari sushi was heavenly. Unforgettable.[nl]I want to eat more. So let me stay here.                                     
RAK/RAK0035080
Y-you can't stay here![nl]Go back to the shrine!  
OTM/OTM0003370
But it's boring at the shrine! No one ever visits,[nl]or comes to worship, or anything! You knucklehead!
RAK/RAK0035090
Reversed anger!?
OTM/OTM0003380
Just go make me some inari sushi!             
RAK/RAK0035100
Damn, she's really not backing down...        
OTM/OTM0003390
If thou canst understand me,[nl]nod like an adult.
OTM/OTM0003400
Use thy imagination. The incarnation of divine favor[nl]is sitting in front of thee, mkay?
OTM/OTM0003410
In fact, I can arrange a relationship between the[nl]and the "special someone" thou art thinking of...[nl]Mwehehe...
RAK/RAK0035110
N-no, don't![nl]I can do that myself, thank you!
OTM/OTM0003420
Is that a fact? Well, I guess it is up to thee,[nl]after all...
OTM/OTM0003430
Anyway, I'll be here for a month.[nl]If thou changeth thy mind, feel free to[nl]worship me.
RAK/RAK0035120
Has it already been decided that you will live here!?
OTM/OTM0003450
Please let me live here!
RAK/RAK0035130
--------
RAK/RAK0035140
You're putting a lot of effort into this.
RAK/RAK0035150
It's just too much to defy a goddess...[nl]I guess... Only for a month, though. Okay?
OTM/OTM0003460
Mhm, mhm!
RAK/RAK0035170
However! Don't let Dad or Ryuu see you![nl]And don't show yourself in public![nl]That's the deal. Okay?
OTM/OTM0003470
I'll remember that.
OTM/OTM0003480
Mm-hmm, now that I hath secured lodging in this world,[nl]the only thing left to do is to fulfill my goal.
RAK/RAK0035180
Goal? Are you up to something?
OTM/OTM0003490
Why dost thou even care? It's hardly a big deal.
OTM/OTM0003500
There are many, many more important things than my goal.[nl]Listen with thy heart.
RAK/RAK0035190
Ehh.... L-like what?
OTM/OTM0003510
Like flipping the tofu upside-down when making inari sushi.[nl]I prefer it that way.
.........
RAK/RAK0035200
........Is that important?
OTM/OTM0003520
Mm-hmm. Don't forget it.
OTM/OTM0003530
Well then, thou shalt take care of me for the next month.[nl]Raku.
RAK/RAK0035210
Got it, got it.[nl]Welcome to my house, Otama.
RAK/RAK0035220
(Jeez... Now I'm stuck with this weirdo for a whole month.)
RAK/RAK0035230
(A whole month, huh?[nl]I hope nothing bad happens...)
