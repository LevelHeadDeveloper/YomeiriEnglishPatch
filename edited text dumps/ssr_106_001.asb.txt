So, on TV yesterday....!
WSA/WSA0000090
Ah! I saw that, too! That was hilarious!
@ＢＧＭ再生
.......
RAK/RAK0053630
How come you're just standing there all spaced out?
@expose
SSR/SSR0012980
....Oh, it's just you, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0053640
Sorry it's just me. So, what are you doing?
SSR/SSR0012990
Nothing, really.....[nl]I was just keeping an eye on the Mistress.
RAK/RAK0053650
Chitoge?
SSR/SSR0013000
She's made herself a lot of friends at this school.[nl]Since she told me it was hard making friends[nl]back in the U.S.,[nl]I'm happy for her.
RAK/RAK0053660
(Well, she did have a pretty hard time here at first, too.[nl] ....She made a friend notebook and everything.)
SSR/SSR0013010
Ever since she arrived in Japan,[nl]she's been enjoying herself a lot more than before.
SSR/SSR0013020
She always wanted to be able to just[nl]have a good laugh with her friends like that.
RAK/RAK0053670
....You say that like you're a stranger.[nl]You're one of her friends, too.
SSR/SSR0013030
Me? One of her friends?[nl]Absurd.... I'm merely a bodyguard.
SSR/SSR0013040
We've certainly been acquaintances for a long time,[nl]but that's hardly the same as being friends.
RAK/RAK0053680
Tsugumi.....
Chitoge considers you a friend.
Are you really OK with that?
RAK/RAK0053690
I think Chitoge would say you're her friend....
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
SSR/SSR0013050
Ghh....[nl]You act like you know what you're talking about.
RAK/RAK0053700
I've been dating her for half a year,[nl]so I feel like I would know.
SSR/SSR0013060
That's some big talk coming from you, Raku Ichijo....
RAK/RAK0053710
Are you okay with that?
SSR/SSR0013070
------
RAK/RAK0053720
You don't look like you are.
RAK/RAK0053730
If just listening is too lonely,[nl]you should head over there and join them.
SSR/SSR0013080
M-Me? In their group?
RAK/RAK0053740
It would be a great opportunity to get[nl]to know all the others, right?
RAK/RAK0053750
I get it, you care a lot about Chitoge.[nl]But you also need to think about yourself a little,[nl]and try to enjoy your own school life.
SSR/SSR0013090
My school life....
CTG/CTG0013950
Hahahahahahaha!
SSR/SSR0013100
....No, I don't think I will after all.
RAK/RAK0053760
Huh?
SSR/SSR0013110
Unlike the Mistress,[nl]I am only here as a bodyguard.
SSR/SSR0013120
I don't know when I might have to go back[nl]to the U.S. for another mission.... I'm certain,[nl]if I make friends here, that will only make it harder to leave.
RAK/RAK0053770
SSR/SSR0013130
In the meantime, I thank you for your concern.
SSR/SSR0013140
But please forget we had this talk.[nl]I'll be fine the way I am.
RAK/RAK0053780
....Doesn't look like it to me.
