Sounds good
We'll hang out after school

SSR/SSR0022320
After school?
SSR/SSR0022330
So like, that would, um....[nl]that would be like a date?
SSR/SSR0022340
....Very well.[nl]I'll be looking forward to it.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0022350
Sorry to keep you waiting.
SSR/SSR0022360
It took me a while to convince Claude[nl]to take over looking after the Mistress....
SSR/SSR0022370
I had some trouble coming up with an excuse,[nl]because I couldn't tell him what we're doing.
SSR/SSR0022380
You need to make sure this[nl]stays a secret too, okay?
Of course
Why keep it a secret?
@ssr_401_021
SSR/SSR0022390
This'll be our secret, huh.[nl]Hehe.... My heart is pounding.
@ssr_401_022
SSR/SSR0022400
Are you saying you're okay with[nl]Master Claude coming to kill you when he finds out?
SSR/SSR0022410
Haha, no need to get so flustered.[nl]I was just trying to scare you a little.
@expose
SSR/SSR0022420
And even if that does happen,[nl]don't worry. I'll keep you safe.
@ssr_401_023
SSR/SSR0022430
But I do want to tell everyone someday.[nl]The Mistress, Master Claude....
SSR/SSR0022440
Of course, when I heard you weren't really[nl]dating the Mistress, you can imagine I was surprised.
SSR/SSR0022450
But I also felt a sense of relief....
SSR/SSR0022460
Whoops....[nl]Time really flies during long conversations like this.
SSR/SSR0022470
So, where shall we go today?
Let's just wander around
I can feel Claude's presence!
@ssr_401_024
SSR/SSR0022480
Sounds good. Sometimes it's not so bad[nl]to just walk around aimlessly.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0022490
Look. A stall selling cream puffs!
SSR/SSR0022500
Their outsides are cooked to a perfect golden brown,[nl]surrounding a creamy filling.... They look delicious.
@ssr_401_024_1
Get some cream puffs
Go to the arcade
@ssr_401_025
SSR/SSR0022510
Oh, you want some, too?
SSR/SSR0022520
Then let's get in line, quickly.[nl]Hurry!
SSR/SSR0022530
Nom.... Ohh, that's good![nl]It's so sweet and tasty!
SSR/SSR0022540
Hm? What are you staring at?
There's some cream on your cheek
Your eating face is cute
@ssr_401_026
SSR/SSR0022550
Huh? Oh....s-sorry.[nl]Is it gone now?
@expose2
SSR/SSR0022560
H-Hey![nl]Stop trying to lick it off!
SSR/SSR0022570
Even if it doesn't bother you, you're embarrassing me[nl]to death, so cut it out!
@ssr_401_027
SSR/SSR0022580
That's probably because you're with me.
SSR/SSR0022590
If I were alone, I probably wouldn't be[nl]buying snacks at all.... Hehe.
@ssr_401_028
SSR/SSR0022600
Ahhh.... That was delicious.
SSR/SSR0022610
Is this the kind of place you usually go?
SSR/SSR0022620
If you could, I'd like you to take me[nl]to some of the places you frequent.
My house
A bookstore, maybe?
@ssr_401_029
SSR/SSR0022630
Y-Your house!?
SSR/SSR0022640
It's, um....[nl]It's too early for that!
SSR/SSR0022650
Why are you in such a hurry....[nl]To be in your room together, alone....
SSR/SSR0022660
A-Anyway, we can wait to go to your house![nl]....At least until I'm ready!
SSR/SSR0022670
For today, we can go to your favorit bookstore.[nl]Just to be safe!
@ssr_401_030
SSR/SSR0022680
A bookstore, huh.[nl]Good idea.
SSR/SSR0022690
Hm. I'm curious to see what kinds of books[nl]a normal high school student would read.
SSR/SSR0022700
If it's okay, I'd like to see[nl]what kinds of books you'd recommend.
SSR/SSR0022710
That way, we can have one more thing in common.
@ssr_401_031
SSR/SSR0022720
Mgh.... It's already this late, huh.[nl]I guess we have been talking for a while.
SSR/SSR0022730
Today was fun.[nl]I was even able to buy the manga you recommended.
SSR/SSR0022740
Let's go out again together sometime.[nl]I'll let you know what I think of that manga.
SSR/SSR0022750
In the meantime, you should[nl]read the book I recommended.
@マジコイ終了処理
@ssr_401_032
SSR/SSR0022760
Hehe, if you really want to play video games,[nl]you're actually a child.
SSR/SSR0022770
But that's okay.[nl]I still owe you after those shooting games we played.
SSR/SSR0022780
This time, I'll really work with you[nl]to kill those zombies!
SSR/SSR0022790
Alright, we've cleared that stage!
SSR/SSR0022800
I think we're starting to work together[nl]somewhat better than before.
SSR/SSR0022810
Maybe we can clear all the stages together!
@ssr_401_033
SSR/SSR0022820
Aaaargh![nl]We've lost....
SSR/SSR0022830
And we were so close, too....[nl]Even though it's just a game, it's still frustrating.
SSR/SSR0022840
Today was a lot of fun.[nl]Let's go out together again sometime.
SSR/SSR0022850
Next time, I want to kill *all* the zombies.[nl]Heheh.
@ssr_401_034
SSR/SSR0022860
Alright, that's all of 'em!
SSR/SSR0022870
You're pretty good with that gun.[nl]You'd be a welcome addition to the Beehive.
SSR/SSR0022880
It wouldn't be so bad to have you with me[nl]on a mission like this.
SSR/SSR0022890
Oh, looks like the final round's started.[nl]Cover me!
SSR/SSR0022900
Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]We managed to win.
SSR/SSR0022910
Haha.... I never thought a game like this[nl]would get me so heated.
SSR/SSR0022920
It's getting pretty late,[nl]so I should be going now.
SSR/SSR0022930
Returning home safely[nl]after a long battle with the zombies, so to speak.
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
SSR/SSR0022940
I had a lot of fun today. Um....[nl]If you want, feel free to ask me out again sometime.
SSR/SSR0022950
Later.[nl]See you at school.
@ssr_401_035
SSR/SSR0022960
What? You think Master Claude is nearby?
SSR/SSR0022970
Aaah, don't grab my hand so suddenly![nl]What are you doing!?
SSR/SSR0022980
You're trying to escape Master Claude?[nl]But where would we go....?
@ssr_401_035_1
Somewhere with not many people!
Somewhere crowded!
@ssr_401_036
SSR/SSR0022990
Seems like we've lost him.[nl]Good grief, Master Claude is such a nuisance.
SSR/SSR0023000
That being said....[nl]There really aren't a lot of people here.
SSR/SSR0023010
Well, there are people, but....[nl]It looks like they're all couples.
SSR/SSR0023020
----[nl]When I see people hugging and kissing all around me like this....
Feeling self-conscious?
Excited, are we?
@ssr_401_037
SSR/SSR0023030
Yep....[nl]I'm really at a loss for where to look....
SSR/SSR0023040
Even so....they're amazing. Their feelings are[nl]so strong that we and everyone else do not exist to them.
SSR/SSR0023050
H-How can they do this in a public place?[nl]God, it's just....not something we need to see.
@ssr_401_038
SSR/SSR0023060
W-Who would get excited over something like this!?
SSR/SSR0023070
I'm getting embarrassed just watching them!
@ssr_401_039
SSR/SSR0023080
....Do you also, umm....[nl]You really want to do something like this, too?
@ssr_401_039_1
........
Not really
@ssr_401_040
SSR/SSR0023090
W-Why aren't you saying anything!?
SSR/SSR0023100
S-So you *do* want to do that....
SSR/SSR0023110
....And do you want to do it with *me*?
SSR/SSR0023120
Wait, what am I saying!?
SSR/SSR0023130
Never mind! Forget everything I just said!
SSR/SSR0023140
Hey, quit staring at me like that![nl]We're leaving!
@ssr_401_041
SSR/SSR0023150
Oogh, if I stick around too much longer,[nl]my heart will pound out of my chest.
SSR/SSR0023160
Let's go out again properly sometime.
SSR/SSR0023170
Well then....[nl]S-See you later.
@ssr_401_042
SSR/SSR0023180
I-I see....
SSR/SSR0023190
I-It's just me, then?[nl]Does that....make me a bit strange?
SSR/SSR0023200
I didn't think I'd want to[nl]do that with you....
Do what?
You're not strange
@ssr_401_043
SSR/SSR0023210
Y-You know, um....
SSR/SSR0023220
Ki....
SSR/SSR0023230
K....ki....
SSR/SSR0023240
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY *THAT*!?
SSR/SSR0023250
God, you're so insensitive.[nl]....Idiot.
@ssr_401_044
SSR/SSR0023260
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0023270
Now that I'm looking,[nl]I'm noticing your face is also red.
SSR/SSR0023280
....You weren't thinking the exact[nl]same thing, were you?
SSR/SSR0023290
....I-I see.
SSR/SSR0023300
So you have such thoughts as well....
@ssr_401_045
SSR/SSR0023310
Well, okay.[nl]We've come all this way, let's stop somewhere.
SSR/SSR0023320
Oh....[nl]Um, you don't need to let go of my hand....
@ssr_401_045_1
But I'm embarrassed!
Got it. I won't let go
@ssr_401_046
SSR/SSR0023330
You don't want to hold hands because[nl]it's embarrassing?
@ssr_401_047
SSR/SSR0023340
You're the one who took my hand in the first place,[nl]you selfish bastard....
@ssr_401_048
SSR/SSR0023350
T-Thanks.[nl]Then, let's continue as we have been.
SSR/SSR0023360
Haha.... This isn't the first time we've held hands,[nl]but it's embarrassing looking at it again like this.
SSR/SSR0023370
....Your hands are warm.
@ssr_401_049
SSR/SSR0023380
Okay, where should we go now?
Let's just wander around
Let's look at appliances
@ssr_401_050
SSR/SSR0023390
Appliances?[nl]Stuff like refrigerators and computers?
SSR/SSR0023400
I can't say I know a lot about that[nl]sort of thing.
SSR/SSR0023410
For some reason, machines always give me trouble.[nl]Like lie detectors.
That's true
You're overthinking
@ssr_401_051
SSR/SSR0023420
You agree with me?
SSR/SSR0023430
It's not as though I'm *bad* at using these things,[nl]but I'll avoid operating them if I can....
SSR/SSR0023440
And that's why I don't like[nl]household appliances.
@ssr_401_052
SSR/SSR0023450
No, that's not true.
SSR/SSR0023460
It's possible I'll run into some trouble[nl]if we do this, is that okay?
@ssr_401_052_1
Uhhhh.....
Sounds great
@ssr_401_053
SSR/SSR0023470
Hey![nl]Stop looking so obviously disgusted!
SSR/SSR0023480
....Well, anyway, I'm not really[nl]in the mood to shop for home appliances.
@ssr_401_054
SSR/SSR0023490
Heh....[nl]You seem awfully relaxed about it.
SSR/SSR0023500
With that kind of composure,[nl]you could probably handle any problems....
SSR/SSR0023510
Nevertheless, we probably shouldn't[nl]take that kind of risk.
@ssr_401_055
SSR/SSR0023520
Why don't we just walk around looking at[nl]a bunch of stores today?
SSR/SSR0023530
It's called window shopping.[nl]Sometimes I do it with the Mistress....
SSR/SSR0023540
And today, I want to do it with you.
Not like I have a choice
I'll go wherever you want
@ssr_401_056
SSR/SSR0023550
The hell do you mean,[nl]you don't have a choice!?
SSR/SSR0023560
Times like these,[nl]you should just say yes and move on.
SSR/SSR0023570
Now let's go![nl]Look sharp.
@ssr_401_057
SSR/SSR0023580
Hehe.... Well said.
SSR/SSR0023590
Then let's go have a nice, thorough walk around.[nl]We'll be doing a lot of walking, so are you ready?
@ssr_401_058
SSR/SSR0023600
I see.[nl]Sometimes it's not so bad to just wander aimlessly.
SSR/SSR0023610
What's important sometimes isn't *where* you go,[nl]but *who* you go with....
@ssr_401_059
SSR/SSR0023620
Hmm.[nl]So they've already got winter clothes on sale.
SSR/SSR0023630
But what is it, exactly, that women find appealing[nl]about wearing this sort of frilly clothing?
SSR/SSR0023640
Going to the trouble to wear something so uncomfortable....[nl]I don't understand it.
They'd look great on you
Guys think they're cute, right?
@ssr_401_060
SSR/SSR0023650
T-There's no way I could pull off[nl]a skirt like that!
SSR/SSR0023660
I've worn something like this before,[nl]but people just stared at me....
SSR/SSR0023670
I guess I didn't look good in it,[nl]so I stood out like a sore thumb....
I doubt that
Because you were cute!
@ssr_401_061
SSR/SSR0023680
Is that right....[nl]It's kind of hard to believe, but....
SSR/SSR0023690
But if you say it's true....[nl]Maybe I can see myself humoring the idea a little.
@ssr_401_062
SSR/SSR0023700
Ghhh.... How on earth can you[nl]say something like that so nonchalantly?
SSR/SSR0023710
If you keep saying those things....[nl]I might find myself believing them....
@ssr_401_063
SSR/SSR0023720
Is that a fact?
SSR/SSR0023730
Hm?[nl]....So then you'd like how it looks, too.
SSR/SSR0023740
Maybe I'll try wearing some girly clothing[nl]once in a while....
SSR/SSR0023750
No, not for you or anything.[nl]Just as training to infiltrate society.
@ssr_401_064
SSR/SSR0023760
I think it's been long enough now.
SSR/SSR0023770
If Master Claude hadn't been chasing us around,[nl]I feel like we could've stuck together a bit longer.
SSR/SSR0023780
Well, it's fine.[nl]I'll still be seeing you from here on out.
SSR/SSR0023790
Well then, I guess I'll be going.
@ssr_401_065
SSR/SSR0023800
Hm? Is something the matter?
I'll walk you home!
Nothing
@ssr_401_066
SSR/SSR0023810
Could I actually just walk by myself?
SSR/SSR0023820
Hehe, just messing with you.[nl]I'll humor your request this time.
SSR/SSR0023830
Lead the way, then.
@ssr_401_067
SSR/SSR0023840
I see. Never mind, then.
@ssr_401_069
SSR/SSR0023860
Today was lots of fun.[nl]Let's do this again sometime.
