OTM/OTM0000570
Raku, are you making my inari sushi yet? I must eat soon, or I shall lose my strength....
RAK/RAK0011070
Ah, in a sec. I gotta make breakfast for the guys first...
@expose
OTM/OTM0000580
What.....!
OTM/OTM0000590
Have you no humanity? No blood or tears?[nl]To treat me like this when I am so feeble....[nl]For this, I may curse your family for generations!
RAK/RAK0011080
No one's cursing anyone's family for generations![nl]I never said I wouldn't feed you, so shut up and wait!
RAP/RAP0000240
Hey, Raku, who are you talking to....?
RAP/RAP0000250
...Huh, there's no one here.[nl]Raku, what are you doing talking to yourself?
RAK/RAK0011090
D-Dad!? N-No....I didn't say anything....[nl]Maybe you're hearing things.
RAP/RAP0000260
....Well, I guess it doesn't matter.[nl]Everyone wants to act things out alone at some point.
RAK/RAK0011100
（What the hell does that even mean![nl] Ahhh, I want to deny it so badly![nl] But that would just make things harder to explain....）
RAK/RAK0011110
....Hey, how come you're up so early?[nl]I've started making breakfast already, so it's too late[nl]to ask for something different.
RAP/RAP0000270
I wouldn't be here for something that small.[nl]I need a favor.
RAK/RAK0011120
What is it? Usually, when you ask me for a favor,[nl]it turns out to be some kind of huge hassle.[nl]I'd like to avoid trouble, okay?
RAP/RAP0000280
What, this one's easy.
RAP/RAP0000290
Can you just bring some more inari sushi over to that[nl]shrine in the outskirts? The priest asked me again.
RAK/RAK0011130
I don't mind doing that, but....
RAK/RAK0011140
 (But Otama's here already....[nl] Well, I guess I shouldn't tell him that.)
RAK/RAK0011150
....Got it. I'll drop it off before I go to school.
RAP/RAP0000300
Okay, I'm counting on you.
OTM/OTM0000600
Awesome~! Good work, priest!
OTM/OTM0000610
Come on, hurry up and make it for me![nl]Then bring it to the shrine like last time, m'kay?[nl]I'll make it my 3 o'clock snack.
RAK/RAK0011160
.....Really, you're too excitable.[nl]Alright, just wait a second.
OTM/OTM0000620
Aah! How many times must I tell you[nl]to turn the skin inside out!?
RAK/RAK0011170
....Yeah, yeah, yeah.

RAK/RAK0011180
  (Seriously, she's really got a thing for inari sushi.[nl]I mean, I like it when people like the food I make,[nl]but she's just oppressive about it....
RAK/RAK0011190
....Okay! I've delivered the inari sushi!
RAK/RAK0011200
Well, it doesn't look like she'll complain much about this.[nl]Time to go to school....
RUR/RUR0000660
I see....[nl]So that's how it happened....
KSK/KSK0005040
What should I do.....
RAK/RAK0011210
(Huh? Those voices....)
@フェードアウト
@背景変更2
RAK/RAK0011220
(Huh? Onodera and Miyamoto!?[nl] What are they doing here so early in the morning?)
KSK/KSK0005050
Ruri, help me~~~!!
RAK/RAK0011230
(Help her....![nl]Onodera, what is it!?)
RUR/RUR0000670
It's frustrating, isn't it.[nl]I'm at least happy it's been progressing faster lately.
KSK/KSK0005060
I guess you're right....[nl]After all, I want to tell him properly.
RUR/RUR0000680
Chin up. Just one step left now, right?
KSK/KSK0005070
Uuuuuu~....
RUR/RUR0000690
But....[nl]Maybe, instead of just doing it out of the blue,[nl]try setting up a situation where it's easier.
RUR/RUR0000700
In terms of conveying the message properly,[nl]under the tree is considered the standard.
RUR/RUR0000710
Personally, I prefer under the bell.
KSK/KSK0005080
Under the bell? What does that mean, Ruri?
RUR/RUR0000720
Don't worry about it, it isn't a big deal.
RAK/RAK0011240
(What the hell are you two talking about?)
RAK/RAK0011250
(I thought Onodera was in some kind of trouble....[nl] I guess, if I really think about it,[nl] I was eavesdropping just now....)
RAK/RAK0011260
(What should I do...I'm curious about what they'll say next!)
Leave like a gentleman
Listen a bit longer
@pan
RAK/RAK0011270
(After all, eavesdropping is rude.[nl]I guess it's time to head to school....)
RAK/RAK0011280
(If I leave now, I'm not a man![nl]I'll stay here and listen to them[nl]until they're done talking!)
RAK/RAK0011290
(O-Oh no....!?)
KSK/KSK0005090
?
RUR/RUR0000730
What is it, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0005100
Nothing, I thought I heard something just now....
RAK/RAK0011300
M-Meow.....
KSK/KSK0005110
Oh, it's just a cat.
RUR/RUR0000740
Are you sure?[nl]To me, it sounds like someone making cat sounds.
RAK/RAK0011310
(Geh-!)
RUR/RUR0000750
I'll go check it out.
RAK/RAK0011320
(Uwahhh, no, don't come back here![nl] I'll get caught~!)
CAT/CAT0000050
Mreow!
KSK/KSK0005120
Kyah!?
RAK/RAK0011330
(Ahh! I-It's a real cat!?)
KSK/KSK0005130
T-That caught me off guard....
RUR/RUR0000760
....I guess it actually was a cat.[nl]I wonder if it's chasing some prey.
RAK/RAK0011340
(Phew....[nl] Did I manage to keep my cover?)
RAK/RAK0011350
(I shouldn't be doing this, after all.[nl] Time to head to school....)
@背景変更
RUR/RUR0000770
Oh, and also....this shrine.[nl]It's a little-known power spot for love, I've heard.
KSK/KSK0005140
That's right.[nl]I'd heard that a while ago.
KSK/KSK0005150
....I wonder if my wish will come true....
RUR/RUR0000780
Even if it's just a wish or whatever,[nl]isn't it better then just doing nothing?
KSK/KSK0005160
I guess so....[nl]....Yes.
KSK/KSK0005170
Ruri, I think i get it now.[nl]I'll try my best to tell him properly!
RUR/RUR0000790
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.[nl]Make sure you pin him down. Okay?
KSK/KSK0005180
Oh....! N-N-N-N-No, I won't do that! Ruri, you idiot!
RUR/RUR0000800
You should be fine with that kind of momentum.
RUR/RUR0000810
Well then, lemme just send the email for you.
KSK/KSK0005190
Huh!? R-Right here?
RUR/RUR0000820
Right here.
RAK/RAK0011360
...Hm?[nl]Who sent me an email?
RAK/RAK0011370
Huh!?　T-This is....[nl]An email from Onodera!?
RAK/RAK0011380
(Let's see....[nl] "Meet me under the Tree of Tradition[nl] behind the school"?)
RAK/RAK0011390
...Traditional tree?[nl]Does our school even have one of those?
SYU/SYU0000940
Oho......![nl]Hast thou been summoned to the Tree of Tradition?
RAK/RAK0011400
What the hell, man. Do you know about it?
@ホワイトアウト
SYU/SYU0000950
The school which we attend,[nl]Bonyari High School,[nl]has a certain....legend of love.
RAK/RAK0011410
Hey, what's with the sudden theatrics?
SYU/SYU0000960
There's an old tree near the edge of the schoolyard....[nl]Its name...."Tree of Tradition"!
SYU/SYU0000970
And under this tree, lovers united by the confession[nl]of a young lady are said to live happily ever after!
SYU/SYU0000990
Many a young man has wished to partake in this legend....
RAK/RAK0011420
I-I wonder if there is such a tree....[nl]I had no idea.
SYU/SYU0001000
Hoh, hoh, hoh! Tell  me, Raku,[nl]what thou meant by that....
RAK/RAK0011430
Huh!? N-No, that's....[nl]Lemme say that again.
SYU/SYU0001010
....I see.[nl]Well, best of luck, buddy!
RAK/RAK0011440
Thanks!
RAK/RAK0011450
(Aahh, I'm so nervous.....)
RAK/RAK0011460
(After all, an email from Onodera, asking me to meet her[nl] in a high-profile confession spot....[nl] This might be....this might not be....
RAK/RAK0011470
(No, calm down, Raku Ichijo.[nl] If I get too excited and make a mistake, I'll be blindsided.[nl] Calm, stay calm....!）
RAK/RAK0011480
(For example, if I were to turn around[nl] and see a Beehive agent....)
CLD/CLD0000590
!
RAK/RAK0011490
(The heck~!!!)
RAK/RAK0011500
(That was Claude just now, wasn't it!?[nl] He doesn't usually come into the school![nl] What the hell is he up to!?
RAK/RAK0011510
----------
RAK/RAK0011520
(There's no mistake....[nl] He's following me for sure!)
RAK/RAK0011530
(I have to find a way past him[nl] so I can get to Onodera!)
