I wonder where we'll all be in 10 years.
RAK/RAK0071960
....Huh? That came outta nowhere.
SYU/SYU0013650
No, no, I was watching a TV show about that yesterday.
CTG/CTG0020340
Oh, I saw that![nl]That was the one showing couples that got together[nl]in high school and ended up getting married, right?
CTG/CTG0020350
I'll bet it's wonderful to be in love for so long, huh.
SYU/SYU0013660
Yeah, yeah, it must be. ....Though I wonder where[nl]you and Raku will be in 10 years, Kirisaki.
RAK/RAK0071970
Huh!?
CTG/CTG0020360
U-Us!?
@expose
SYU/SYU0013670
There's no reason you two can't stay together, right?[nl]Speculation is free, so why not try it out and imagine being[nl]married or something?
RAK/RAK0071980
W-Why would I do that....!?
CTG/CTG0020370

RAK/RAK0071990
.....Whaaa!?[nl]What the hell did you just think!?
CTG/CTG0020380
Huh!? I-I didn't think anything![nl]Y-You're the one who's thinking something embarrassing[nl]right now, aren't you!?
RAK/RAK0072000
I-I'm not thinking anything like that!
CTG/CTG0020390
T-That's riiight![nl]If I married you, we'd be fighting every single day!
SYU/SYU0013680
They also say that the more you fight, the better you[nl]get along. Don'tcha think that's true?
RAK/RAK0072010
Jeez, quit acting like it's not your problem.[nl]Chitoge's right, if I married such a violent woman,[nl]I'd be getting beaten to death every day.
CTG/CTG0020400
Wh-What the hell!?[nl]Who are you calling a violent wife....
SYU/SYU0013690
Well, well, well!
SYU/SYU0013700
Hahaha, sorry, sorry. Well, if you don't feel like marrying,[nl]there's no point imagining it.
RAK/RAK0072020
Exactly. First of all, who knows what the future holds?
CTG/CTG0020410
CTG/CTG0020420
That's right. We have no idea what the future holds....
CTG/CTG0020430
But maybe being with you 10 years from now[nl]wouldn't be too bad.
@ザクシャ千棘・中
RAK/RAK0072030
....Huh?
CTG/CTG0020440
Well! Man, I'm getting thirsty.[nl]I'm gonna go buy a drink!
RAK/RAK0072040
What did she mean by that?
SYU/SYU0013710
Well, she didn't see me....
CTG/CTG0020450
Yeah, yeah.[nl]No one knows what's gonna happen years down the line.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
RAK/RAK0072050
Right. As it stands, I can barely predict[nl]what will happen tomorrow.
SYU/SYU0013720
Haahaahaa![nl]And I'm grateful for the entertainment!
RAK/RAK0072060
Dammit....[nl]That's irritating.
CTG/CTG0020460
Hehehe.[nl]But I do hope we can be good friends for a long time.[nl]Ten years, and beyond....
