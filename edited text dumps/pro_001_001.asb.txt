(The girl I met 10 years ago, and quickly befriended...)
RAK/RAK0034190
(She was my first love, for sure.)
RAK/RAK0034200
(We promised each other over this pendant that we'd[nl]meet again someday. It's still my prized possession.)
RAK/RAK0034210
A promise like that and I can't even remember her face, huh.
RAK/RAK0034220
I wonder if we'll ever meet again...
