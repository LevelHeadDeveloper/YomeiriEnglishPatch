But hey, I'm me, and I might still be[nl]too self-conscious to endure this, maybe....
CTG/CTG0005780
'Cause you know what? Just because we're together[nl]all the time, that doesn't make us real lovers.
CTG/CTG0005790
Doesn't that bother you?
Does it bother you?
It does....
Not really
CTG/CTG0005800
Yeah, I guess so.
CTG/CTG0005810
We both have the freedom to[nl]choose our own lovers, right?
CTG/CTG0005820
So it's still on my mind.
CTG/CTG0005830
I can't help but wonder if you're[nl]okay being here with me....

Huh!?[nl]R-Really!?
CTG/CTG0005850
But you're not saying you're going to[nl]be my real boyfriend, right?
CTG/CTG0005860
Well, maybe this extreme situation is making[nl]my mind play tricks on me....
CTG/CTG0005870
Hahaha....we both have the freedom to[nl]choose our own lovers, right?
