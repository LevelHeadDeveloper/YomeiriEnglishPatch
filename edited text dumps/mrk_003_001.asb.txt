SYU/SYU0001530
Oh, yeah~,[nl]girl's tennis is as good as ever.
RAK/RAK0022670
Hey, Shuu. How long do[nl]you plan on staring at the tennis court?[nl]We should be playing soccer with the boys.
SYU/SYU0001540
What are you talking about, Raku![nl]These fine young ladies are trying their very[nl]hardest right next to us!
SYU/SYU0001550
Glistening with sweat,[nl]they dash around the court[nl]and swing their rackets with all their strength....
SYU/SYU0001560
If that kind of sight doesn't get you going,[nl]you're hardly a man.
RAK/RAK0022680
Right, right, whatever....
SYU/SYU0001570
Well, the only thing that could make this better[nl]would be if they were wearing skorts.
SYU/SYU0001580
Wouldn't you love to see that, too, Raku?[nl]Onodera, Kirisaki, and the others[nl]fluttering around in skorts!
SSR/SSR0009640
But first, how about fluttering around in the sky?
SYU/SYU0001590
Heya, Seishiro![nl]You heard that, didn't you?
SYU/SYU0001600
If you want, Seishiro, you could wear a skort too![nl]White, pink, blue....[nl]I can hook you up with any color you want!
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0001610
Ghaackkk!?
SSR/SSR0009650
Who the hell would wear that!?
SYU/SYU0001620
H-Hang on, Seishiro![nl]It was just a little joke!
SSR/SSR0009660
Your jokes are blatant sexual harrassment![nl]Drop dead, pervert!
@画面揺らし2
SYU/SYU0001630
Gyaaahhhh~~!
RAK/RAK0022690
(He still hasn't learned his lesson....)
MRK/MRK0002290
Raku dearest~~~~!
@expose
RAK/RAK0022700
Oh, you're here too, Tachibana.[nl]What is it?
MRK/MRK0002300
I want you to hear my Statement of Determination.
RAK/RAK0022710
Statement of Determination?
MRK/MRK0002310
Yes![nl]I figured, since you're currently dating Kirisaki,[nl]you must be in the market for a livelier woman....
MRK/MRK0002320
So I'll show you how lively I am today[nl]by playing the best tennis I can!
MRK/MRK0002330
To that end, I will win every match,[nl]whether it's against Tsugumi or Kirisaki!
RAK/RAK0022720
No, no, even with your best,[nl]I don't think anyone can beat them.
@expose2
MRK/MRK0002340
Heheheheheh.....[nl]Besides the normal, direct approach,[nl]there are other ways of winning....
RAK/RAK0022730
Scary! You're scaring me!
MRK/MRK0002350
Hahaha.....I'm only joking.[nl]First of all, I don't even go up against either of them,[nl]so don't worry.
MRK/MRK0002360
But I still intend to not lose[nl]a single match today.
RAK/RAK0022740
Well....whatever.[nl]I'm rooting for you, but don't push yourself.
MRK/MRK0002370
Yeah, just leave it to me!
MRK/MRK0002380
With your support, Raku dearest,[nl]I have a great reason to push myself as hard as I can!
RAK/RAK0022750
(But I just told you not to do that....)
MRK/MRK0002390
So, I'll try my very hardest![nl]The theme is "Love・Effort・Victory・"!
RAK/RAK0022760
Um, don't you mean "Friendship"?
MRK/MRK0002400
....Sometimes there are things more important than friends.[nl]Especially if they're my dearest Raku!
RAK/RAK0022770
....Take care of your friends, too.
MRK/MRK0002410
....After I take care of you,[nl]I'll consider it.
RAK/RAK0022780
(I hope Tachibana doesn't push herself too hard....[nl] I'm worried.)

MRK/MRK0002430

KSK/KSK0007510
Aaaaaieeeeee!
SYU/SYU0001640
....Hey, Raku.
RAK/RAK0022790
What, Shuu.
SYU/SYU0001650
This is soothing....
RAK/RAK0022800
....Yeah.[nl]Now I understand what you were saying before.
SYU/SYU0001660
So, which one are you rooting for?[nl]Onodera? Or maybe Marika?
RAK/RAK0022810
Well, obviously Onodera....[nl]Well, that's what I'd usually say.[nl]This time I'm rooting for Marika.
RAK/RAK0022820
She said she was gonna try her hardest for me,[nl]so I have to watch her.
SYU/SYU0001670
....I see.
RAK/RAK0022830
(Ahh, but Onodera's so cute, and she's trying so hard....[nl] I can't help but watch her, too!)
RAK/RAK0022840
(Huh!? Stop, stop![nl] We have to watch Marika now!)
MRK/MRK0002460
Fwehh, hahh, hahh....
RAK/RAK0022850
(Hmm? Could it be, she's....)
SYU/SYU0001680
Hmm? What is it?
RAK/RAK0022860
Sorry. I'll be back in a sec.
SYU/SYU0001690
Huh? Are you going to the tennis court?
MRK/MRK0002470
Well, then, Onodera, let's go![nl]With this new Super Deadly Magic Serve[nl]I've created, it's time to decide the match!
KSK/KSK0007520
S-Super Deadly!? That's a thing!?
MRK/MRK0002480
Try and block my passionate feelings for Raku dearest![nl]Marika in Loooooooove~!
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0022870
Stop--!
@expose
MRK/MRK0002490
Hyahhh!
KSK/KSK0007530
Ichijo!?
RAK/RAK0022880
Sorry Onodera. We gotta let Tachibana rest for a sec.
KSK/KSK0007540
Huh? O-Okay, I don't really mind...
MRK/MRK0002500
No! Raku dearest, I can still---
RAK/RAK0022890
Just get into the shade!
RAK/RAK0022900
You look pale, Tachibana.[nl]You've been pushing yourself pretty hard, haven't you?
MRK/MRK0002510
Ugh, I've been found out....
KSK/KSK0007550
Huhh, really!? Sorry. I didn't realize....
MRK/MRK0002520
Quite all right, Onodera![nl]If it was serious, I wouldn't be[nl]as lively and energetic as I am!
MRK/MRK0002530
Well then, let's continue the game!
RAK/RAK0022910
You promised not to push yourself.
MRK/MRK0002540
We can still play~~~!
RAK/RAK0022920
(Guh....she's surprisingly stubborn.[nl] I need to convince her to take a rest....)
MRK/MRK0002550
Please let go~!
RAK/RAK0022930
Alright, come on![nl]We'll talk over here, just the two of us.
MRK/MRK0002560
Eh, J-Just us?
MRK/MRK0002570
I-I guess....just for a bit.
RAK/RAK0022940
(Her attitude changed quickly....)
