Alright. You've reached the checkpoint.[nl]Now head for the next one.
RAK/RAK0082910
Hey, Tsugumi, are we really still doing this?
SSR/SSR0021460
Of course. There's still two more checkpoints to go.
RAK/RAK0082920
Huh!? Seriously!?
SSR/SSR0021490
Just be cautious and try not to hurry.[nl]Usually, when an agent doesn't come back from a mission,[nl]it's because they were too hasty and not cautious enough.
RAK/RAK0082930
Just so we're clear, let me ask....[nl]Under what circumstances would an agent not come[nl]back from a mission?
SSR/SSR0021500
Do you really want to know?
RAK/RAK0082940
No, forget it....[nl]I feel like it would involve too much blood.
SSR/SSR0021510
Okay then. You need to focus or you won't make it home, okay?
RAK/RAK0082950
Oogh, crap....
