Hey, Raku!
RAK/RAK0065010
Dad!?
CTP/CTP0000380
Hey, Raku. How are you?
RAK/RAK0065020
....And Chitoge's dad, too.[nl]What are you two doing here?
RAP/RAP0000570
Well, we were both in the neighborhood anyway,[nl]so we decided to get a drink together.
CTP/CTP0000390
And I'm doing this behind my subordinate's backs.
RAK/RAK0065030
You and my dad really are close.[nl]So why do our gangs end up fighting all the time?
CTP/CTP0000400
Hmmmm.... That's a difficult question.[nl]I suppose it's because Claude and the others are still[nl]young and hot-headed.
RAP/RAP0000580
And I guess Ryuu doesn't like it when strangers[nl]come into our territory.
RAP/RAP0000590
We can easily suppress them with all our strength,[nl]but that'd hardly be fitting of the family's[nl]central provider, right?
CTP/CTP0000410
Besides, using such great power can easily[nl]sow the seeds of a new conflict.
RAK/RAK0065040
(Ohh....[nl] So our dads really are giving this situation proper thought.)
RAP/RAP0000600
Well, that's more or less why this town's peace[nl]will continue to depend on you and Miss Chitoge[nl]for the time being.
CTP/CTP0000420
I'm sorry for causing you and my daughter all this trouble,[nl]but we're counting on you to keep helping us.
RAK/RAK0065050
Uh, yes....
RAP/RAP0000610
Alright, Raku! You're gonna join us here, too![nl]And while we're at it, tell us how far you've gotten[nl]with the young lady!
RAK/RAK0065060
Huh....!?
CTP/CTP0000430
Sounds good to me. I'd like to hear about what she's[nl]like at school, and to be honest, I'd also like to know[nl]your personal feelings about her.
RAK/RAK0065070
D-Dad! You're just gonna use what I tell you[nl]as a conversation over drinks!
RAP/RAP0000620
What else is there?[nl]Just join us!
CTP/CTP0000440
Of course, you'll need something non-alcoholic.[nl]I'm not letting you leave tonight.
RAK/RAK0065080
Aaargh....[nl]Look, I've got dinner to make, and homework to do,[nl]so I need to hurry up and get home.
RAK/RAK0065090
So goodbye!
RAP/RAP0000630
Tch.... He ran away.
CTP/CTP0000450
What a shame. We'll have to wait for some[nl]other time to share a meal with him.
