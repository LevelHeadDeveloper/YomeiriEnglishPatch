Hahh.... It's been too long since we've done anything.[nl]Raku, let's do something fun.
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0072150
That's a bit unreasonable all of a sudden. It's your life,[nl]so why not entertain yourself, instead of relying on[nl]others to do it for you?
CTG/CTG0020570
Mghh....! If it was that simple,[nl]we wouldn't be having this conversation!
@expose
CTG/CTG0020580
I mean, to begin with, that kind of attitude is the whole[nl]reason no thought or planning goes into our scheduled[nl]dates. You should at least plan dates a little more seriously.
RAK/RAK0072160
Huh!? Why's the conversation going that way!?
RAK/RAK0072170
First of all, while we're on that subject,[nl]you haven't made any kind of solid plans yourself!
CTG/CTG0020590
Come on, that's not even the girl's responsibility.[nl]It's up to the guy to escort her.
RAK/RAK0072180
Isn't it kinda unfair to only play the "woman" and "man"[nl]cards only in situations like this?
RAK/RAK0072190
If you're gonna do that, you should try to be[nl]a little more "womanly" and stop being so crass.
CTG/CTG0020600
Hey, now that's just terrible![nl]How exactly am I crass to begin with!?
RAK/RAK0072200
You're pretty quick to yell at me, just saying!
RAK/RAK0072210
If you keep acting so spoiled,[nl]you might lose out on some affection.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0020610
Affection....!?[nl]I-I-I don't even care about your affection to begin with!
RAK/RAK0072220
Huh!? I didn't mean *mine*![nl]I meant that of whoever you end up liking!
CTG/CTG0020620
Whaddya talking about!?[nl]I don't need *you* worrying about that!
RAK/RAK0072230
Come on, I was just worried![nl]You're such a-- Jeez!
CTG/CTG0020630
You really are a--

CTG/CTG0020650
Pfft....
CTG/CTG0020660
Hahahaha! Now we're talking at the same time!?
RAK/RAK0072250
Hahh....[nl]This whole argument's honestly gotten kinda stupid.
RAK/RAK0072260
Can't we just bad mouth each other and call it even?
CTG/CTG0020670
Works for me.[nl]And here, you can have this for your ignorance.
RAK/RAK0072270
What's this? A magazine?
CTG/CTG0020680
It's one of those free magazines.[nl]It's about interesting date spots in our city.
CTG/CTG0020690
Look through that, and try to plan out our next date.
@ザクシャ千棘・中
RAK/RAK0072280
Plan our next date....
RAK/RAK0072290
(Maybe instead of reading these,[nl] she could make a plan herself....[nl] I just don't understand her....)
CTG/CTG0020700
Well, okay.[nl]I wonder how many more times we'll have to fight.
RAK/RAK0072300
Let's see. If we fight once a day every school day,[nl]that's around 500 times until the end of our third year.
CTG/CTG0020710
....Don't actually do the math.
CTG/CTG0020720
But 500 more times until the end....huh.[nl]....It's shorter than you might think.
RAK/RAK0072310
Huh!?
CTG/CTG0020730
....Just kidding.
