Hm? What's with this crowd of people?
RAK/RAK0076200
Gah!?[nl]Why the hell are these two facing off!
@ＢＧＭ再生
CTG/CTG0022880
Pardon me, Tachibana.[nl]I think you've been meddling too much[nl]with my darling these days.
MRK/MRK0013110
Oh, Kirisaki.[nl]I feel so sorry for Raku dearest, what with[nl]you always holding him back.
MRK/MRK0013120
I understand that Raku dearest is immensely attractive,[nl]but surely there must be other men worthy of your affections.
@expose
MRK/MRK0013130
I've gathered some pictures of potential partners for you.[nl]Here.
CTG/CTG0022890
O-Ohh. So these looks like humans to you, Marika.[nl]To me, they kinda look like gorillas, don't they?
MRK/MRK0013140
That's because they *are* gorillas. ♪[nl]You'd have to be crazy to think those could be humans. ♪
CTG/CTG0022900
Hahaha! What a terrible joke.[nl]You're probably so hot for my darling that the heat[nl]melted your brain.
MRK/MRK0013150
Oh, is it that obvious how passionate Raku dearest and I are[nl]for each other? You can't hide true love, after all.
RAK/RAK0076210
(Aaaaaah! W-What is going on!?)
RAK/RAK0076220
(Why are they doing this in front of the classroom!?)
RAK/RAK0076230
(I'd better get outta here and hide on the rooftop[nl] or with the animals until this blows over!)
CTG/CTG0022910
....What are you sneaking around for, Darling?
RAK/RAK0076240
Geh!?
MRK/MRK0013160
Raku dearest![nl]If you wanted to listen in, you should have told me.
RAK/RAK0076250
N-No....[nl]I was just trying not to get involved....
MRK/MRK0013170
She needs to hear it from you, Raku dearest.[nl]Tell her "we should break up".
RAK/RAK0076260
Did you not hear what I just said!?
CTG/CTG0022920
Why are you only talking to Marika!?[nl]Whose side are you on!?
RAK/RAK0076270
When did we start talking about sides!?
CTG/CTG0022930
Isn't it obvious!? She pushed me to the edge,[nl]and I can't exactly just stay quiet!
MRK/MRK0013180
Today, you're going to tell us clearly[nl]which of the two of us you prefer, Raku dearest!!
RAK/RAK0076280
Uh....
RAK/RAK0076290
Well.... Y-You're both very attractive,[nl]and I can't quite decide.... How's that?
CTG/CTG0022940
Do you really think that's an answer?
MRK/MRK0013190
We won't let you go until you answer.
RAK/RAK0076300
How is it you only get along during times like this!?
CTG/CTG0022950
Now, which of us do you like better!?
MRK/MRK0013200
Please tell us, Raku dearest!
RAK/RAK0076310
Uuuuuhhhh....[nl]What should I say.....
Marika
Chitoge
I can't answer!

RAK/RAK0076315
....T-Tachibana....
MRK/MRK0013220
F....
@ザクシャ万里花・中
MRK/MRK0013230
Finallyyyy!!
MRK/MRK0013240
At last, my historic moment![nl]My EPIC WIN!
CTG/CTG0022960
N-No way....[nl]I can't believe I'd lose to Marika....
RAK/RAK0076320
(Sorry, Chitoge![nl] I'll make some excuses for you later,[nl] but I need you to resign quietly here!)
MRK/MRK0013250
Now we absolutely must throw a massive party[nl]for the entire school!
MRK/MRK0013260
I'm going to go announce everything[nl]over the school PA system!
RAK/RAK0076330
(D-Don't do thaaaat!)
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0022970
H-Hmph! Naturally.[nl]I am his boyfriend, after all.
RAK/RAK0076340
(Well, this should have better results, anyway.)
CTG/CTG0022980
But you should have answered faster.[nl]I feel like an idiot for getting so worked up....
RAK/RAK0076350
Huh? Were you nervous, by any chance?
CTG/CTG0022990
S-Shut up! I'm your girlfriend,[nl]so it would have been embarrassing to lose!
CTG/CTG0023000
W-Well, of course I can't stand you!
RAK/RAK0076360
Aaagh, you idiot![nl]Don't say that here!
CTG/CTG0023010
Huh....?
CTG/CTG0023020
Uh, I-I was just kidding![nl]Of course I love you!
RAK/RAK0076370
Of course.[nl]We are lovers, after all. ♪
MRK/MRK0013270
....I don't approve.[nl]I don't approve of this!
MRK/MRK0013280
....I'm certain Raku dearest is suffering very much[nl]because he can't express his true feelings[nl]in front of his terrible girlfriend!
MRK/MRK0013290
I do not approve of this!
@expose2
RAK/RAK0076380
Oh, where are you going, Tachibana!?
CTG/CTG0023030
You don't need to bother chasing her,[nl]she'll be back in the afternoon anyway.
CTG/CTG0023035
You don't need to bother chasing her,[nl]she'll be back tomorrow anyway.
CTG/CTG0023040
But....I guess it must be kind of sad when the person[nl]you love doesn't love you back, huh?
CTG/CTG0023050
....I've messed up a little, haven't I?
....
CTG/CTG0023060
I'll be a little bit nicer to her when[nl]she gets back.
RAK/RAK0076390
I-I can't just make a decision like that so lightly![nl]Enough of this, both of you!
CTG/CTG0023070
Ngh! W-Why you...!
MRK/MRK0013300
Hehehe, you could have just thrown your embarrassment to[nl]the wind and said "I like Marika Tachibana".
RAK/RAK0076400
I just said I'm not saying anything![nl]I'm leaving now!
CTG/CTG0023080
Aah! Wait just a second!
RAK/RAK0076410
(This is the sort of thing you have to run away from!)
