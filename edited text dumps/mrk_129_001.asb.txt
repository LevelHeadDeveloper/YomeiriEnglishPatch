Jeez, Raku dearest.[nl]Trying to leave like that without telling me was[nl]not very nice at all.
RAK/RAK0080150
Whether or not it was nice,[nl]we live in opposite directions.
MRK/MRK0017110
That doesn't matter to me at all.[nl]I don't want to be away from you for a minute,[nl]or even a second.
KSM/KSM0000250
Oh. If it isn't Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0080160
Oh, Onodera's mom!
MRK/MRK0017120
Huh? Is this Onodera's mother?
KSM/KSM0000260
You a friend of Kosaki's?
MRK/MRK0017130
Yes. My name is Marika Tachibana.
MRK/MRK0017140
Raku dearest gave me some sweets from your shop some time ago.[nl]I must say, they were delicious.
KSM/KSM0000270
Ohh, my, is that right?[nl]I *am* glad they were to your taste.
MRK/MRK0017150
I will be coming in to buy some next time.
KSM/KSM0000280
Hehe. ♪　We'll be waiting.
KSM/KSM0000290
But wait.... Are the two of you on a date?[nl]Am I interrupting something?

MRK/MRK0017160
Yes, we are!
RAK/RAK0080170
Hey! Don't lie so brazenly!
RAK/RAK0080180
We're not, ma'am![nl]Our relationship isn't like that at all!
MRK/MRK0017170
Raku dearest....[nl]You don't need to deny it so hard.
RAK/RAK0080190
....!?[nl]S-Sorry, I--
KSM/KSM0000300
Hmmmm, you are quite the lady killer, aren't you, Ichijo?[nl]No wonder Kosaki's always so eager to see you.
RAK/RAK0080200
Huh? What's this about Onodera?
KSM/KSM0000310
...Ohh, I've said too much.[nl]Never mind that.
KSM/KSM0000320
You *must* come back and help us at the shop again.[nl]I'll increase your hourly wage.
RAK/RAK0080210
Yes. I'd be happy to.
KSM/KSM0000330
If you want, you can even be my son-in-law. ♪
RAK/RAK0080220
Yes. I'd be ha--
RAK/RAK0080230
Wait, huh!? Son-in-law!?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0017180
No, no, no, no, no!
MRK/MRK0017190
No matter how good of a friend Kosaki is,[nl]there is NOOOO WAY I'm letting that happen!
RAK/RAK0080240
....Hey, don't get more agitated than I am.
MRK/MRK0017200
What's no good is no good!
KSM/KSM0000340
Ohhh. I guess it'll be pretty hard to land Ichijo.[nl]You'd be a great help to our shop.
KSM/KSM0000350
Whoops, I guess it's too late in the day[nl]to be worrying about the shop.
KSM/KSM0000360
Well then, I'll leave you two to it.[nl]I may ask you to help out again on short notice pretty soon,[nl]but until then....
MRK/MRK0017210
Good grief....[nl]What things that woman said to *my* Raku dearest![nl]I can't let down my guard for even a second!
RAK/RAK0080250
I, um, not really yours.....
MRK/MRK0017220
This is your fault too, Raku dearest![nl]I can't believe you're in thick with Onodera's family[nl]when you already have me!
RAK/RAK0080260
You, um, aren't really mine, either....
RAK/RAK0080270
I mean, stop getting such weird ideas.[nl]I just work part-time at their shop occasionally,[nl]like I said earlier.
MRK/MRK0017230
I guess that's alright....
MRK/MRK0017240
....By the way, is working part-time lucrative?
RAK/RAK0080280
I wonder. I guess if you're diligent and work hard,[nl]you can save up a decent amount of money.
MRK/MRK0017250
Hmmm....I see.
MRK/MRK0017260
A part-time job....[nl]That doesn't sound so bad.
MRK/MRK0017270
If I work hard enough, I can make my dream come true....
RAK/RAK0080290
Is there something you want to buy?
MRK/MRK0017280
Yes. But, that's a secret. ★
