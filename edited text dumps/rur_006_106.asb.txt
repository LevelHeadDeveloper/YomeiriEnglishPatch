That's right....
RUR/RUR0006900
One of the biggest selling points of glasses[nl]is the contrast between wearing them and taking them off.
RUR/RUR0006910
A girl who is usually plain, but then is cuter than expected[nl]when she takes her glasses off....
RUR/RUR0006920
Regardless of gender, there must be a lot of people[nl]who'd find that kind of gap attractive, right?
Would they?
You'd have to be a pervert
It's a very niche thing

Damn it....surely, if you didn't wear glasses,[nl]you'd be cute anyway.....

You're doing it, Ichijo.[nl]You're getting an idea of what's going on with this world.
RUR/RUR0006960
Is that so? Well, I don't know[nl]what that feels like myself....
RUR/RUR0006970
But the fact that you can take them off and put them on[nl]and make yourself look different is a big deal.
RUR/RUR0006980
You don't need to argue with me.[nl]Because their is no room for argument.
RUR/RUR0006990
Anyway, glasses are good and wonderful.
