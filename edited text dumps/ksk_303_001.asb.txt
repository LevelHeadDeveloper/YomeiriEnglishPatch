RAK/RAK0051210

Raku, Raku, Rakuuuu!
RAK/RAK0051230
You're trying to leave without permission again....
@expose
OTM/OTM0005680
Thou art going shopping, correct?[nl]Can I go with thee? Lemme come with thee![nl]I mean, I shall come with thee!
RAK/RAK0051240
Have you forgotten the rules for living with me?[nl]I told you so many times not to go out in public.
OTM/OTM0005690
Worry not. If someone is about to see me, I shall disappear.
OTM/OTM0005700
Besides, even if I am seen,[nl]they shalt not know who I am. They shall merely[nl]think that thou art a bit of a fool.
RAK/RAK0051250
That's a huge problem!
RAK/RAK0051260
....Jeez. I won't buy you any snacks, you know.[nl]Don't go being whiny, okay?
OTM/OTM0005710
Hmph. Treat me not as a child.[nl]But I did notice a lack of fried tofu for inari sushi[nl]in the fridge. And that is something I refuse to give up!
RAK/RAK0051270
Right, right. Understood.
RAK/RAK0051280
Alright. We've got all the ingredients we need for dinner.[nl]All that's left is to get Otama's fried tofu.
OTM/OTM0005720
Oh, yes! Hehehe, I am glad.
RAK/RAK0051290
Ah, there it is![nl]Oh, it's the only one left.
KSK/KSK0015760
Huh? Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0051300
Huh!? Onodera!?
RAK/RAK0051310
Hey, Otama! Disappear!
OTM/OTM0005730
Mmmgh, I guess it cannot be helped....
KSK/KSK0015770
....What? Seemed like there was a girl here just now....
RAK/RAK0051320
R-Right? It was probably just your imagination.
KSK/KSK0015780
Hmmm? Is that right?
KSK/KSK0015790
Oh, Ichijo. Were you here to buy fried tofu, by any chance?
RAK/RAK0051330
Yeah. You too?
KSK/KSK0015800
Yes. But there's only one of these left....
RAK/RAK0051340
No, I'm fine. You can have it, Onodera.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0015810
Huh!? But that might inconvenience....
OTM/OTM0005740
That it would![nl]That is my tofu!!
KSK/KSK0015820
Huh!? Who said that!?
RAK/RAK0051350
Hey, hey, calm down![nl]Why don't we just stop by another store!?
OTM/OTM0005750
Rrrrgh.....!
KSK/KSK0015830
You should just buy this one, Ichijo.[nl]I'll stop by the store near my house.
RAK/RAK0051360
No, it's fine! Really, I can just[nl]go to another store.
KSK/KSK0015840
Hehehe, there's no end to this.[nl]It's fine. I'll just go to the nearest store.
KSK/KSK0015850
Well, I'll be going now, okay?
RAK/RAK0051370
O-Okay! See ya, Onodera.
KSK/KSK0015860
See you later, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0051380
Jeez. She ended up letting me take this after all.
OTM/OTM0005760
....A fine young lady.[nl]I liketh her.

RAK/RAK0051390
Ahhh, I'm stuffed~.
OTM/OTM0005770
Ahhhh, what lovely fried tofu that was.
RAK/RAK0051400
It's all thanks to Onodera for letting us have the last one.[nl]Be sure to thank her, okay?
OTM/OTM0005780
Hohoho. I shall be on top of that.
RAK/RAK0051410
Huh? On top of it?[nl]What do you mean by--
RAK/RAK0051420
Hm? Who could it be at this hour?
RAK/RAK0051430
O-Onodera!?
KSK/KSK0015870
G-Good evening....
RAK/RAK0051440
What's the matter, why are you here so late!?
KSK/KSK0015880
Well, actually, we made too much dinner....
KSK/KSK0015890
So my....mother asked me to bring you[nl]this extra inari sushi.
RAK/RAK0051450
Inari sushi?[nl]O-Okay. Thanks.
KSK/KSK0015900
Ah. I didn't make this, okay?[nl]I did taste it and serve it....
RAK/RAK0051460
No, I don't really care about that.
RAK/RAK0051470
But as long as you're here,[nl]would you like a cup of tea?
KSK/KSK0015910
Thanks. I'd love to stay,[nl]but I'm going to Ruri's house after this.
RAK/RAK0051480
I see, that's just as well, then.
KSK/KSK0015920
Well....see you later, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0051490
Yeah, take care.
RAK/RAK0051500
,....The hell was that, Otama?
OTM/OTM0005790
The hell was what?
RAK/RAK0051510
Don't play dumb with me.[nl]You set that up, didn't you?
OTM/OTM0005800
Mwehehe. 'Twas merely a coincidence.
OTM/OTM0005810
If thou doth not want that inari sushi, I shall eat it.[nl]Give it here.
RAK/RAK0051520
Oh, hey![nl]I'm gonna have some too!
OTM/OTM0005820
Nom nom nom..... Ohhh, this is delicious![nl]It has a different flavor from thy inari sushi!
RAK/RAK0051530
It sure is good. That extra sweetness is just perfect....
OTM/OTM0005830
Raku, take that girl as thy wife.
RAK/RAK0051540
Gahck! W-Why bring that up all of a sudden!?
OTM/OTM0005840
That way, I can eat her inari sushi and thine![nl]'Tis a good idea!
RAK/RAK0051550
(But Onodera's mother is the one who made these.)
