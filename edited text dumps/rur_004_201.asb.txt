By the way, there is one thing I'm wondering about.
RAK/RAK0030920
Huh?
@expose
RUR/RUR0004240
Why has that cardboard box on the floor[nl]been moving slowly closer to us this whole time?
@ＢＧＭ再生
.....
RAK/RAK0030930
(You couldn't possibly have been more[nl] obvious if you tried, Shuu....)
RUR/RUR0004250
I can kind of guess what's in there....[nl]Anyway, I'll just lift it.
SYU/SYU0004150
Haha...hahaha....you found me?
RUR/RUR0004260
Maiko....why were you approaching me under a box?[nl]And you even had your camera all ready....
SYU/SYU0004160
I was planning to hide under the table[nl]and pop up and scare you, Ruri....[nl]Would you believe that?
RAK/RAK0030940
Shuu....[nl]That's the most strained excuse I've ever heard.
RUR/RUR0004270
After I warned you repeatedly,[nl]you'd still try to do something as shameless[nl]as sneaking a picture, huh.
RUR/RUR0004280
Your sheer audacity is beginning[nl]to make me feel more impressed than dismayed.
SYU/SYU0004170
W-Wow, your high praise is embarrassing me!
RUR/RUR0004290
Yes. So let me give you a little token of my esteem.[nl]Prepare yourself----
RUR/RUR0004300
HIYAAAAAAAAAH!

SYU/SYU0004180
AAAAAAAAAAAGH![nl]THE CAMERA'S BUSTED!
SYU/SYU0004190
O-Oh no, the data....[nl]NYAAAAAAAGH! THE MEMORY CARD'S IN PIECES!
SYU/SYU0004200
You've gotta be kidding.... All the data I've been collecting[nl]until now is gone....! Those were valuable photos[nl]for my beautiful-girl-photo-book....!
SYU/SYU0004210
I-It's too muuuuuuuch!
RAK/RAK0030950
I feel a little sorry for him....[nl]But it's hard to have too much sympathy....
RUR/RUR0004310
If you've learned your lesson,[nl]don't ever think of pulling anything like this again.
RUR/RUR0004320
Oh, waiter. Can I also have a[nl]"Special Jumbo Strawberry Parfait" please?
RUR/RUR0004330
....Also, please pick up this bawling four-eyes.
RAK/RAK0030960
Y-You're merciless, Miyamoto....
RAK/RAK0030970
(Maybe it would be best if I[nl] didn't make her my enemy....)
