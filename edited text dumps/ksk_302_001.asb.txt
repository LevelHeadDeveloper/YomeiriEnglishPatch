Ahhhh. it's been a while since I've gone bowling,[nl]that was fun.
RAK/RAK0051060
Yeah. Even if it was just the two of--
KSK/KSK0015680
....Right?
RAK/RAK0051070
!! That sounds like....
SYU/SYU0008690
Hmm? What is it?
@ＢＧＭ再生
KSK/KSK0015690
I bought this dress the other day, and I think it might have[nl]been a bit of a mistake. The clerk recommended it to me,[nl]but when I had another look at it, the skirt was too short.
RUR/RUR0011650
Why not just return it, or force yourself to wear it?[nl]When you're young, you can usually wear anything[nl]you want anyway.
@expose
KSK/KSK0015700
Jeez, don't say that so nonchalantly.
RAK/RAK0051080
.....It's Onodera.
SYU/SYU0008700
Hohoho. Your Onodera sensor is well-calibrated, huh, Raku.[nl]It seems neither of them has noticed us, so let's follow them.
RAK/RAK0051090
The hell you mean "Onodera sensor"....[nl]I mean, it wouldn't be right to tail them,[nl]so let's not do it.
@expose2
SYU/SYU0008710
No, no, we're not "tailing" them. They just happened[nl]to go the same way we were gonna go. So let's go!
RAK/RAK0051100
Oh, hey, Shuu![nl]....Dammit, he's gone off on his own again! Wait up!
@時間経過演出2
SYU/SYU0008720
Oho, looks like they're eating ice cream now.[nl]It looks yummy. You wanna have some, too?
RAK/RAK0051110
....Hey, if they found out we were hiding[nl]behind this telephone pole, we'd be out 100%, right?
SYU/SYU0008730
Hey, hey. C'mon, you can hear their[nl]conversation just fine from here, right?
KSK/KSK0015710
....just, I....I wish I could be a little more proactive,[nl]but it just isn't working out that way.
RUR/RUR0011660
Well, that's the kind of person you are, Kosaki.
RAK/RAK0051120
(Hmmm? Proactive?[nl] What the hell are they talking about?)
KSK/KSK0015720
But just because *you* like someone[nl]doesn't mean *they* like *you*.
RUR/RUR0011670
True. If it's as you say,[nl]then you have a textbook "one-sided crush".
RAK/RAK0051130
(Whaa.....w-wait![nl] Onodera has a crush on someone!?)
KSK/KSK0015730
But I still can't give up,[nl]and I'll keep trying my very best.....
RAK/RAK0051140
(S-She likes this guy *that much*!?[nl] Onoderaaaaa!!!)
SYU/SYU0008740
Ohh~? What a big problem this is!![nl]I didn't know Onodera had someone she liked,[nl]no, no, this could get interesting. ★
RAK/RAK0051150
Would you.....cut the nonsense[nl]when I'm clearly very upset?
RUR/RUR0011680
Well, I'm glad you're giving it your all.[nl]I hope one day the god of cooking will return your love.
@ＢＧＭ停止
......
RAK/RAK0051160
Huh? God of cooking?
RUR/RUR0011690
Well, if you're still heartbroken....if you're still[nl]a bad cook in the end, that's okay. It won't be a problem[nl]if you just marry a guy who's a great cook.
KSK/KSK0015740
No. That's not the problem.[nl]I just really want to be a good cook!
KSK/KSK0015750
There was a part of me that had given up on ever[nl]being a good cook until now....but I'm going to practice[nl]more proactively from now on! Just you watch, Ruri!
RUR/RUR0011700
Right, right. I'm not tasting anything you make, though.
SYU/SYU0008750
Sounds like it was just a metaphor.
SYU/SYU0008760
Onodera, who can't cook to save her life, practices[nl]proactively to become a better cook.... In other words,[nl]she wants to be in love with the god of cooking.
RAK/RAK0051170
W-What's this....[nl]So Onodera doesn't have someone she likes....[nl]Oh, that's seriously a surprise!
SYU/SYU0008770
Hohoho, that's too bad~![nl]I thought for sure I'd get to see your heart break, Raku!
RAK/RAK0051180
Cut the crap.....hahh.[nl]Let's just stop tailing them, already.
SYU/SYU0008780
Huh? But this seems like a great time to get started.
RAK/RAK0051190
No, no, I kinda feel bad for Onodera and Ruri,[nl]and I really can't do this anymore....[nl]Sorry, but I'm just gonna go on home.
SYU/SYU0008790
Hey, wait a sec, Raku.
SYU/SYU0008800
She wants to be in love with the god of cooking, huh.
SYU/SYU0008810
That sounds like it could mean something different!
