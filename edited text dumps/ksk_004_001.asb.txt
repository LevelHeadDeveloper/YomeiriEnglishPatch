......Hey.
RAK/RAK0010110
Yeah?
SYU/SYU0000890
How are things lately?[nl]Any luck with Onodera?
RAK/RAK0010120
W-What the hell? That came out of nowhere.
SYU/SYU0000900
Don't underestimate my observational skills![nl]Lately, it seems to me that the two of you are getting[nl]even closer! Am I right?
RAK/RAK0010130
(Wow, how can he even tell?)
RAK/RAK0010140
(Truthfully, I've wanted to confess a few times lately.....[nl] But every time I tried, I got interrupted....)
SYU/SYU0000910
Oh-....
@expose
SYU/SYU0000920
Listen, Raku.[nl]There's something good coming your way, ya know?
RAK/RAK0010150
.......Hm? What do you mean?
@ＢＧＭ停止
SYU/SYU0000930
It'll be a critical moment for you as a man, so be careful![nl]Farewell, buddy!
RAK/RAK0010160
Huh? Hey, Shuu!
RAK/RAK0010170
(He's gone....I don't know what he meant.)
RAK/RAK0010180
(Well, I guess I'll go home by myself.)
RAK/RAK0010190
(Hm? Who's that up ahead....)
RAK/RAK0010210
(Shuu....This must be what you meant!)
RAK/RAK0010200
.....Onodera?
KSK/KSK0004060
Huh? Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0010220
W-What a coincidence.[nl]Are you here by yourself today?
KSK/KSK0004070
.....Y-Yes.[nl]I am, but.....
RAK/RAK0010230
....What's wrong?
KSK/KSK0004080
Actually, I think I lost my cell phone.
RAK/RAK0010240
Huh, really!?
KSK/KSK0004090
Yes. I passed through here earlier, before I realized it was[nl]missing, so I'm trying to see if I dropped it here....
RAK/RAK0010250
Would you like me to help?
KSK/KSK0004100
No....I don't want to give you any trouble.[nl]You were on your way somewhere, right?
RAK/RAK0010260
No, I don't have anywhere else to be today,[nl]so we can look for it together.
KSK/KSK0004110
Hmmmmm....[nl]Well then, would you help me, please?
RAK/RAK0010270
Sure! Let's go!
KSK/KSK0004120
.....Thanks! It'd be a big help.
RAK/RAK0010280
(Onodera's so cute......[nl] Alright! We're definitely going to find her phone![nl] Even if I need to search through fire and water!)

@ＢＧＭ再生
KSK/KSK0004130
Ummmmm....[nl]We can't seem to find it anywhere.
RAK/RAK0010290
That's true.[nl]I guess you checked with the police station already, huh?
KSK/KSK0004140
Yes. They didn't have it.
RAK/RAK0010300
I see.....
KSK/KSK0004150
Ah-!?
RAK/RAK0010310
What's wrong, Onodera!?[nl]Did you find it!?
@背景変更
KSK/KSK0004160
A-Awesome.....!
KSK/KSK0004170
Ichijo, look![nl]This cat is so cute!
RAK/RAK0010320
Ah-ah-....[nl]I-I see.....
RAK/RAK0010330
(Hm? What's that....)
@タッチパート開始処理
KSK/KSK0004180
Kyah!
KSK/KSK0004190
What it it!?
RAK/RAK0010340
Hey, Onodera. You see that box the cat is sitting on?[nl]Doesn't it look like a cell phone?
KSK/KSK0004250
Eh!?
KSK/KSK0004200
It's amazing that a cat can balance on a fence this narrow.
KSK/KSK0004210
Isn't she so cute?[nl]Right, Ichijo!?
KSK/KSK0004220
It's a beautiful day, isn't it.
KSK/KSK0004230
Sorry for dragging you along like this[nl]when you could be enjoying it.....
KSK/KSK0004240
Huh? Does it really?
KSK/KSK0004260
Ah, it does![nl]But how'd it get there?
RAK/RAK0010350
I don't know, but let's try to get it back.
I'll distract the cat
Can you distract the cat, Onodera?
RAK/RAK0010360
Alright, I'll try to get her attention and lure her off the fence,[nl]and you can grab the phone.
KSK/KSK0004270
O-Okay...!
RAK/RAK0010370
Pspspspsps....There's a good girl.....[nl]We just need Onodera's phone back, okay....?
CAT/CAT0000010
Mrrrrrrrreeeeooow!
@ＨＰ－１０
RAK/RAK0010380
Gyah!?
KSK/KSK0004280
I-Ichijo! Are you alright!?
RAK/RAK0010390
I think so....[nl]It's no big deal....
CAT/CAT0000020
Meow.
KSK/KSK0004290
Oh, it's coming to me?
RAK/RAK0010400
Onodera, be careful it doesn't scratch you----
RAK/RAK0010410
Onodera, could you see if you could attract her off[nl]the fence? I'll see about the phone.
KSK/KSK0004300
Ah, ok. Got it.
KSK/KSK0004310
Here, kitty, kitty~....
CAT/CAT0000030
Purrurrr....[nl]Meow.
KSK/KSK0004320
Pspspspsps.....[nl]Hahaha, good girl.
RAK/RAK0010420
(Wow, that cat really likes Onodera!!!)
RAK/RAK0010430
....Wait, huh?
RAK/RAK0010440
Sorry, Onodera. This isn't your phone after all, it's just[nl]a box of sweets.
KSK/KSK0004330
Ah, I guess it is. That's too bad....
CAT/CAT0000040
Meow.
KSK/KSK0004340
Ah, that's right! Does your scratch still hurt?[nl]I'll put a bandage on it!
RAK/RAK0010450
Oh, okay....[nl]Thanks, Onodera.
RAK/RAK0010460
(Guuuh....![nl] I don't feel a shred of regret for my injuries....!)
KSK/KSK0004350
Hmm.....I wonder if it's around here somewhere.
RAK/RAK0010470
Me too.....huh?
RAK/RAK0010480
(I-Isn't that Claude over there!?)
RAK/RAK0010490
(If he sees us here like this.....that wouldn't be good!)
RAK/RAK0010500
I-I-I-I don't think it's here.[nl]L-Let's look somewhere else!!
KSK/KSK0004360
Hm? Okay....[nl]Ichijo, you look pale....do you feel alright?
RAK/RAK0010510
Ah, yeah....!
RAK/RAK0010520
(Gehhh.....Claude's getting closer![nl] He'll see us if we don't move faster!)
RAK/RAK0010530
O-O-O-Onodera! L-Let's get moving![nl]Preferably at least Mach 2!
KSK/KSK0004370
O-Okay...!?
@フェードアウト
KSK/KSK0004380
Mmmhhh, we still can't find it....
RAK/RAK0010540
Is there anywhere else you might have dropped it?
KSK/KSK0004390
No.....[nl]We've already checked everywhere I can think of between[nl]when I last had it and when I realized it was missing.....
RAK/RAK0010550
I see.....Mmmm.
KSK/KSK0004400
Thanks for your help, Ichijo.[nl]If we can't find it after such a long search,[nl]I'm sure it's gone.
KSK/KSK0004410
It's okay, though.
RAK/RAK0010560
But.....
RAK/RAK0010570
(We've come this far.[nl] I am going to find that phone, and I'm not giving up!)
