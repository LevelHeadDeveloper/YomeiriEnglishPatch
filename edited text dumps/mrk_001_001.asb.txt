Well, that's it for today's lesson.[nl]I'll be collecting your homework sheets.
KYK/KYK0000020
Ichijo, come help me out.
RAK/RAK0021390
Alright.
RAK/RAK0021400
Hey, guys.[nl]Lemme see your homework.
CTG/CTG0009050
Here, Darling.
SSR/SSR0009500
J-Just take it.
KSK/KSK0007320
Here, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0000960
Here.
SYU/SYU0001310

@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0021410
Oof, w-what the hell, Tachibana!?[nl]What's this crap ton of paper!?
MRK/MRK0000570
It's my love letter to you, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0021420
Love letter!?
MRK/MRK0000580
It's too hard to get your attention with a direct approach,[nl]so I decided to go for a curveball today.★
RAK/RAK0021430
No, this is most definitely a straight ball as well....
MRK/MRK0000590
1500 pages of the love I feel for you, Raku dearest!♪
RAK/RAK0021440
Heavy love!!
@expose
CTG/CTG0009060
Hang on, Marika![nl]You've got some nerve pulling this in front of me!
MRK/MRK0000600
Huh? And you are....[nl]Who are you, again?
CTG/CTG0009070
I'm this guy's g-i-r-l-f-r-i-e-n-d![nl]And you already knew that!
MRK/MRK0000610
Ahh, I see.[nl]You're "tentatively" his "current" girlfriend "for now".
MRK/MRK0000620
As always, thanks for taking good care of my future husband.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0009080
This is a fight, isn't it!?[nl]You're trying to start a fight with me, aren't you!?
RAK/RAK0021450
H-Hey, hey....
SSR/SSR0009510
Rrgh! I can't stand by and watch!
SSR/SSR0009520
Get it together, Raku Ichijo![nl]If you're the mistress's boyfriend,[nl]you should be very firmly on her side!
RAK/RAK0021460
Ehh!? Is this my fault!?
KSK/KSK0007330
G-Guys, please stop fighting.[nl]Look, even Ichijo's upset.
RUR/RUR0000970
Why so timid, Kosaki?[nl]You should be stepping forward here, too.
KSK/KSK0007340
R-Ruri, be quiet!!
RAK/RAK0021470
(Whoa![nl] Onodera's the only one on my side.[nl] As expected, she's so kind~!)
SYU/SYU0001320
Hey, good buddy.[nl]I hate to interrupt your pleasant conversation....
SYU/SYU0001330
But have you looked around?
RAK/RAK0021480
Hm....?
WSA/WSA0000010
Hey, hey....Chitoge and Marika are fighting again.
WSB/WSB0000030
It's carnage, absolute carnage![nl]It looks to me like Kirisaki has the advantage, being his[nl]girlfriend and all, but it's anyone's game!
MSA/MSA0000030
Dammit....why's it always Raku!?
MSB/MSB0000010
It's always Ichijo, It's always Ichijo,[nl]It's always Ichijo!
SYU/SYU0001340
Yeah! Isn't it enthralling?
RAK/RAK0021490
This isn't a laughing matter!
RAK/RAK0021500
(Ughh....[nl] Everyone's curious and angry stares are[nl] piercing through me....)
CTG/CTG0009090
A-n-y-w-a-y! I'll be taking that love letter now!
CTG/CTG0009100
I don't know about the past, but....[nl]Right now, Raku is....m-my boyfriend,[nl]so just give it up.
@ＢＧＭ停止
MRK/MRK0000630
Hahh....[nl]This is troublesome.
MRK/MRK0000640
I didn't want to have to show this to everyone, but....[nl]it can't be helped.
MRK/MRK0000650
I have no choice but to show you all the proof of the[nl]unyielding love between Raku dearest and myself.
CTG/CTG0009110
Proof of the unyielding love...?
CTG/CTG0009120
Raku, what the hell did you do?
RAK/RAK0021510
No, I have no idea what she's even talking about....
MRK/MRK0000660
Well, feast your eyes! Here it is.
@背景変更
@ＢＧＭ再生
SSR/SSR0009530
I-Is that....!
KSK/KSK0007350
Could it be---!
CTG/CTG0009130G
A marriage registratioooon!?
MRK/MRK0000670
That's right! When we were kids, [nl]I made Raku dearest sign--- Raku dearest[nl]and I signed it together, because of our love!
CTG/CTG0009140
You almost just said you "made him sign it", didn't you!
MRK/MRK0000680
Really? When was this?
SSR/SSR0009550
Whaaat is the meaning of this!?[nl]Raku Ichijoooo!
RAK/RAK0021530
W-Wasn't that ten years ago?[nl]I'm sorry, Tachibana, but I don't remember any of this.
CTG/CTG0009150
Y-You forced him to sign it, anyway, didn't you![nl]So it doesn't count!
RAK/RAK0021540
Stop getting so upset over something so small.[nl]Aren't we talking about back in kindergarten, after all?[nl]You're overreacting just a---
@expose
CTG/CTG0009160
You be quiet!
RAK/RAK0021550
...Okay.
MRK/MRK0000690
Heh....I can't let a barbarian like Kirisaki strip away[nl]the fruits of mine and Raku dearest's love!
SSR/SSR0009560
Just give that stack of paper to the mistress!
RAK/RAK0021560
Hey, hey, Tsugumi.....[nl]Stop making such a fuss.
SSR/SSR0009570
Shut up! If you interfere I'll show no mercy!
RAK/RAK0021570
Eeek....!
MRK/MRK0000700
Raku dearest, let us run away for now!
RAK/RAK0021580
Eh!? M-Me too!?
SSR/SSR0009580
Hold it, Raku Ichijo!
CTG/CTG0009170
You're not getting away, Darling!
RAK/RAK0021590
Hey, why are you after me!?
@叫び揺れ
MRK/MRK0000710
Hurry up! Quickly!
RAK/RAK0021600
H-Hey, instead of dragging me away,[nl]we could just give them the letter---
@pan
RAK/RAK0021610
Waghhhhhhhh!
CTG/CTG0009180
Hey, wait!
SSR/SSR0009590
You're not getting away!
.......
RUR/RUR0000980
Pull yourself together, Kosaki.[nl]Now isn't the time to freeze up.
SYU/SYU0001350
Ahh, the treasure of youth~!
KYK/KYK0000030
...Youth is all well and good,[nl]but when will I get that homework?
@フェードアウト
RAK/RAK0021620
(Looks like we've escaped for now.)
RAK/RAK0021630
(I don't think they've figured out we're[nl] hiding out in here, either....)
MRK/MRK0000720
Ahhh! Raku dearest, you're surprisingly bold.
RAK/RAK0021640
You moron! Stop talking so loudly!
MRK/MRK0000730
To push me in here like this....[nl]It's so manly of you.
RAK/RAK0021650
Hey, don't get so close to me!
MRK/MRK0000740
Even if you say that,[nl]there's barely any space in here as it is.[nl]I can't move any further away.
RAK/RAK0021660
There's so much space behind you!
MRK/MRK0000750
Please stop, Raku dearest.[nl]If you continue to speak at such volume,[nl]they will certainly find us.
RAK/RAK0021670
You're telling me!?
MRK/MRK0000760
Do....you dislike it when[nl]I do things like this, Raku dearest?
RAK/RAK0021680
N-No, I wouldn't say I dislike it....
RAK/RAK0021690
It's just that if Chitoge and the others found us like this,[nl]I think they'd kill me this time.
MRK/MRK0000770
Haha. Love will have its obstacles.[nl]As long as it's with you, Raku dearest,[nl]I'm willing to run as far away as I need to.
MRK/MRK0000780
But, it would be nice to live in a world[nl]without such obstacles, wouldn't it?
RAK/RAK0021700
Don't say such weird things while clinging to me!
MRK/MRK0000790
But this still isn't enough for me....
MRK/MRK0000800
Just for a little while, can we stay like this?
RAK/RAK0021710
Uh-.....
RAK/RAK0021720
(Crap....she's really cute up close,[nl] and when we're this close to each other,[nl] I can't help but get nervous!)
MRK/MRK0000810
Raku dearest.... (hug)★
RAK/RAK0021730
H-Hey! Stop!
MRK/MRK0000820
Hehehe....[nl]Raku dearest, I guess you're a boy after all.[nl]Y'know, your face is beet red?
RAK/RAK0021740
Stop teasing me![nl]Being hugged by you, anyone....
MRK/MRK0000830
Anyone....what?
RAK/RAK0021750
....You're surprisingly cruel.
MRK/MRK0000840
If I wasn't so overbearing,[nl]you would barely notice me.
MRK/MRK0000850
Or, maybe you're saying it really, truly does[nl]bother you when I treat you like this?
RAK/RAK0021760
That's....
MRK/MRK0000860
I'm always anxious and nervous because I never know[nl]what you're actually thinking, y'know?
MRK/MRK0000870
Raku dearest....[nl]Do you hate me?
RAK/RAK0021770

RAK/RAK0021780
(When she asks me like that,[nl] I feel like I need to give her a proper answer.)
RAK/RAK0021790
(I'll answer carefully, so as[nl] not to hurt her feelings.)
