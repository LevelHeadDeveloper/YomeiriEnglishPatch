Hey, Raku.[nl]Are you doing anything after school?
RAK/RAK0021950
No, not really.
SYU/SYU0001370
O-kay.[nl]Well then, let's hold a study group at your place today.
RAK/RAK0021960
Huh....Why?
SYU/SYU0001380
Well....since the culture festival's over,[nl]don't we have our exams soon?
RAK/RAK0021970
Ah, yeah, we do.[nl]Fine by me, after all, I haven't been able[nl]to study much lately....
RAK/RAK0021980
But what's the real reason?

@ＢＧＭ再生
SYU/SYU0001390
I want to use the study group as an excuse to[nl]have a fun-fun afternoon with Kirisaki and all the other[nl]hotties in our class!
RAK/RAK0021990
I thought that might be it.
SYU/SYU0001400
Hey, hey, it's fine![nl]I'll invite the girls myself.
MRK/MRK0001570
Of course I'll be there! Raku dearest.★
RAK/RAK0022000
So fast!
SYU/SYU0001410
Awesome! Marika Get!
MRK/MRK0001580
Ah....I do have to get some things ready first,[nl]so feel free to just start without me.
SYU/SYU0001420
OK. With that, I'll see you then, Raku!
MRK/MRK0001590
I'll see you later, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0022010
O-Okay....
RAK/RAK0022020

CTG/CTG0009240
And you just move that over....here.
KSK/KSK0007370
Wow~! Amazing, you solved it already![nl]You're such a good teacher, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0009250
Ehhhh, really~?
SYU/SYU0001430
Ruri~! Help me out with this one~.
RUR/RUR0000990
Don't talk to me, I'm trying to concentrate.
SYU/SYU0001440
Huh~, but this is a study group, after all.[nl]Well then, Seishiro! This problem here's....
SSR/SSR0009600
Do it yourself. Do not deign to get close to me again.
@expose2
SYU/SYU0001450
What!? This isn't how I expected the study group to be![nl]It's not fun-fun at all!
RAK/RAK0022030
I dunno.....
RAK/RAK0022040
Jeez....this whole thing was your idea,[nl]but you're not being serious about studying at all?
SYU/SYU0001460
Come now, I'm always serious, aren't I?
RAK/RAK0022050
(It seriously pisses me off[nl] because he still gets higher grades than me....)
SYU/SYU0001470
Oh, by the way, Marika's still not here.[nl]Is she running late?
RAK/RAK0022060
Well, it has been a while since the rest of us got here....[nl]I'm going to run outside and see.

RAK/RAK0022070
Well, she doesn't seem the type to get lost, but....
MRK/MRK0001600
Hum, hum, hum hum hummm...♪
RAK/RAK0022080
Hm? Humming?
RAK/RAK0022090
(Wait, that sounds like....)
MRK/MRK0001610
Ryuu, can you pass me the soy sauce?[nl]And you guys over there, get those plates ready.
RYU/RYU0000450
O-Okay....
RAK/RAK0022100
What the hell are you doing!?
MRK/MRK0001620
Oh my, Raku dearest.[nl]Well...I'm making your dinner, that's all.
RAK/RAK0022110
That's all!? No![nl]What are you doing in the kitchen[nl]like it's completely normal!?
MRK/MRK0001630
Traditionally, it's a wife's duty to prepare[nl]a delicious dinner for her beloved Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0001640
Haah....![nl]Since you're here, I can have you taste it,[nl]just like we're newlyweds!
MRK/MRK0001650
Well, Raku dearest.[nl]Here, say "ah"!
RAK/RAK0022120
Ahhh....no![nl]We're supposed to be studying, studying!
MRK/MRK0001660
But I'm studying to be your wife by doing the housework.
RAK/RAK0022130
That's quite the stretch....
SEA/SEA0000040
Uh~, young master, this young lady is your classmate, right?[nl]But, just now, she was talking like she was your bride.
RYU/RYU0000460
Ahh, well of course![nl]Is she your new mistress!?
RYU/RYU0000470
Guh-! It's just like we expected, young master![nl]You're clearly head and shoulders over the other guys!
RAK/RAK0022140
What kind of man do you take me for....?
CTG/CTG0009260
Aaaah, Marika!?
CTG/CTG0009270
I heard all that racket,[nl]what do you think you're doing!?
MRK/MRK0001670
Well, I'm cooking for Raku dearest as his wife....
SSR/SSR0009610
Ah, now that you mention it,[nl]weren't you his "former" fiancee who made Raku Ichijo[nl]sign a marriage registration in kindergarten?
MRK/MRK0001680
Raku dearessst![nl]I don't like these people, they're scaring me!
RAK/RAK0022150
I'm more scared of how you're acting....
CTG/CTG0009280
Will you stop glomming all over him!?
KSK/KSK0007380
Whaaa, Chitoge, calm down!
SEA/SEA0000050
A-Amazing![nl]The wife and mistress of the young master[nl]are fighting tooth and nail!
RYU/RYU0000480
That's my boy.[nl]Well, this is gonna be a bloodbath....
RAK/RAK0022160
Will you shut the hell up with that weird nonsense!?
RYU/RYU0000490
Hey, young master, which one's your favorite?
RAK/RAK0022170
Huh...?
RYU/RYU0000500
It's alright. Whoever you love more,[nl]we're always on your side, young master!
RYU/RYU0000510
We will always support your love!
RAK/RAK0022180
No, that's not what's going on....
RYU/RYU0000520
Come on, hurry up and answer.
RAK/RAK0022190
W-Well.....
Who's your number one?
Chitoge
Kosaki
Seishiro
Marika
MRK/MRK0001690
It's Marika, of course.
RAK/RAK0022200
Hey! Stop answering for me!
SSR/SSR0009620
Raku Ichijo....lately, you've been a little too friendly[nl]with Marika Tachibana, even though you're dating the[nl]young mistress. Are you looking to die?
RAK/RAK0022210
It's a misunderstanding---!
KSK/KSK0007390
----
RAK/RAK0022220
O-Onodera! It's not like that![nl]I haven't done anything bad!
CTG/CTG0009290
How come you're explaining yourself for Kosaki[nl]but I get nothing?
RAK/RAK0022230
Y-You too....!?
RYU/RYU0000530
Oooh...! The young master is so popular with the ladies![nl]I'm so happy, I can't stop crying....
RYU/RYU0000540
Arright! For the young master's sake,[nl]let's all help him out!
RAK/RAK0022240
Huh, w-what are you saying....?
RYU/RYU0000550
Young master, to help you decide who's your number one....
RYU/RYU0000560
We'll have a cookin' showdown!
RAK/RAK0022250
What the hell!
SYU/SYU0001480
Teehee....As usual, it's so fun to hang around Raku.[nl]Sensational.♪
RUR/RUR0001000
Are you really his best friend?[nl]I kind of wonder now.
RAK/RAK0022260
Hahhh....[nl]I guess we're seriously having a cooking showdown.
RYU/RYU0000570
The judges shall be myself, the young master,[nl]master Shuu and the young 'uns in the Shuei-Gumi!
SEA/SEA0000060G
Alright!
RAK/RAK0022270
You guys seem to be enjoying yourselves.
SYU/SYU0001500
Oh boy, this is so interesting![nl]Thanks, Raku!
RAK/RAK0022280
You're grinning too much....
CTG/CTG0009300
Jesus.....Why the hell do I[nl]have to cook for Raku as well....?
MRK/MRK0001700
Huh? Well, you know you can always just drop out.
MRK/MRK0001710
Either way, even your finest banana dishes won't[nl]win you Raku dearest's heart.
CTG/CTG0009310
Why am I limited to bananas!?
CTG/CTG0009320
Grr~~! Just you wait![nl]I'm going to make my own original dish!
SSR/SSR0009630
I'll support. I won't let Marika Tachibana[nl]or anyone else defeat you!
KSK/KSK0007400
Oooh....I don't think I can do it.[nl]Mom also told me never to cook outside the house....
RUR/RUR0001010
It's alright. I'll help you.
SYU/SYU0001510
Mhm, mhm, I see.[nl]Team Kirisaki, Team Onodera, and Marika Tachibana, huh.
SYU/SYU0001520
Must be nice, being as popular as you![nl]You get to eat the home-cooked meals of all these girls~.
RAK/RAK0022290
(I can only imagine[nl] the home-cooked hell that awaits me.)
MRK/MRK0001720
Raku dearest![nl]I've made a meal full of my love.[nl]Please, enjoy it!
RAK/RAK0022300
Ooh, that was fast....but I guess[nl]you started a while ago, so it's no surprise.
MRK/MRK0001730
Please dig in while it's still warm.
RAK/RAK0022310
(I guess....even though I didn't ask for it,[nl] she went to the trouble of making me food....[nl] I'll take it gratefully.)
