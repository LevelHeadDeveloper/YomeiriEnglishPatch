SYU/SYU0009630
Yayyy! Let's have a great time!
RAK/RAK0058490
You're all excited all of a sudden.[nl]We only just got here.
SYU/SYU0009640
It's fine, it's fine![nl]It's been a while since we did this with just us guys![nl]Let's have some funnn!
MSA/MSA0000180
It's a lot more exciting with some girls,[nl]but it's nice to have this time with only the boys.
MSB/MSB0000140
Ever since that idiot Ichijo started dating Kirisaki,[nl]we've had fewer and fewer opportunities to do this.
RAK/RAK0058500
Yeah, yeah, it's all my fault.[nl]Jeez, he doesn't even know the whole story.
SYU/SYU0009650
It's fine, it's fine![nl]You can vent to me as much as you need to today.[nl]You've had a lot on your plate lately, haven't you?
RAK/RAK0058515
Ooh, you understand, Shuu![nl]This is why you're my best friend!
SYU/SYU0009660
And in return, everything's on Raku today.
RAK/RAK0058520
Ah, and what a long but short friendship it had been!
@expose2
SYU/SYU0009670
Come onnn, it was only a joke![nl]Now, show us your good enka, Raku!
RAK/RAK0058530
Jeez....what a smooth-talker.
RAK/RAK0058540
I'm gonna go to the bathroom before I sing.[nl]While I'm out, I'll get us some drinks, too.
MSA/MSA0000190G
Thanks!!
@ＢＧＭ停止
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0058550
Hahh, that's a relief.[nl]Now I just need to get some drinks and.....hm?
@ＢＧＭ再生
SSR/SSR0018130
....!?
RAK/RAK0058560
Tsugumi! You're doing karaoke today too!?[nl]What a coincidence.
SSR/SSR0018140
H-Hey, get over here!
RAK/RAK0058570
H-Hey, what the hell!?[nl]Don't push me!
SSR/SSR0018150
What are you doing here!?
RAK/RAK0058580
Well, I'm also in high school.[nl]Once in a while, I'll go do some karaoke with the guys.
SSR/SSR0018160
Hrmmm.....so it would seem all high schoolers[nl]meet up for karaoke....
@expose
SSR/SSR0018170
By the way, how many are in your group?
RAK/RAK0058590
There's 4 of us today. Shuu's here too.
SSR/SSR0018180
Ghh....so that guy's here.[nl]I can't let him know I'm here, too....
RAK/RAK0058600
Gotta say I'm surprised, though.[nl]Didn't know you did karaoke, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0018190
Y-Yeah....
RAK/RAK0058610
And what about Chitoge?[nl]She go to the bathroom too?
SSR/SSR0018200
The Mistress is....n-not here.
RAK/RAK0058620
Huh?
SSR/SSR0018210
....I'm here by myself.
RAK/RAK0058630
Ah, I see.... You do karaoke by yourself, then.
RAK/RAK0058640
When people go to karaoke alone, they do so because[nl]they're either stressed out or really like singing....[nl]Which is it in your case?
SSR/SSR0018220
....Well, I'm doing it more as preparation.
RAK/RAK0058650
Preparation?
SSR/SSR0018230
Everyone in class has invited me to karaoke also.[nl]I promised all the girls I'd go with them next week.
SSR/SSR0018240
But I unfortunately know abysmally little about karaoke....
SSR/SSR0018250
So I figured some enemy reconnaissance....or rather,[nl]a test run to make sure I'm used to karaoke....was in order.
RAK/RAK0058660
You're very serious in a weird way.[nl]Why didn't you just ask someone to show you[nl]how it's done on that day?
RAK/RAK0058670
Like, if you brought Chitoge or someone,[nl]I'm sure she'd be happy to teach you everything.
SSR/SSR0018260
The Mistress is accompanying the boss to a party today.[nl]Today's the only day I can prepare, so I came alone....
RAK/RAK0058680
Ah, I see....
SSR/SSR0018270
By the way, how do I operate this big remote control?[nl]I'm glad I had the courage to come in today, but I have[nl]no idea how to use the machinery....
RAK/RAK0058690
That's where you're coming from.....[nl]It can't be helped. Lemme see it for a sec.
SSR/SSR0018280
Ah....
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
RAK/RAK0058700
What's wrong? I'm just trying to show you how to use it....
SSR/SSR0018290
N-No, sorry.[nl]It's just that we're suddenly sitting next to each other....
RAK/RAK0058710
Yeah, yeah. I know it's not exactly pleasant[nl]for me to be teaching you, but bear with me.
SSR/SSR0018300
That's not what I meant....
RAK/RAK0058720
For now, let's put in the song.[nl]First you need to enter the song title or artist like this....
SSR/SSR0018310
Hm. You're pretty good at this.
RAK/RAK0058730
Then just pick the song you want to sing[nl]from the search results, and....enter!
SSR/SSR0018320
Oh....I know this one.[nl]The Mistress sings it a lot.
RAK/RAK0058740
Well, that's perfect. Go ahead and sing it for me.
SSR/SSR0018330
Huh....? N-No, but....
RAK/RAK0058750
Don't worry about it.[nl]Here, turn on the microphone.
SSR/SSR0018340
Ummmm, the "on" switch.....
@叫び揺れ
SSR/SSR0018350
Waaagh!? W-What the hell!?[nl]My ears are ringing!
RAK/RAK0058760
H-Hey! Don't point the microphone at the speakers![nl]You'll get a headache!
SSR/SSR0018360
....Ah.
RAK/RAK0058770
Gaaaah! Stoppp!
SSR/SSR0018370
I never thought I could make you suffer this way.[nl]I must say, this is a more powerful attack than I thought.
SSR/SSR0018380
Ngh..... Though I'm dealing quite a bit[nl]of damage to myself, as well....
RAK/RAK0058780
Then stop doing it, you idiot!
SSR/SSR0018390
Who are you calling an idiot, you idiot!?[nl]I'll keep doing this!
RAK/RAK0058790
S-Stoppp iiitt!
@キャラ揺らし
SSR/SSR0018400
Graaaahhh!
RAK/RAK0058800
Hahh, hahh, hahh..... You're playing with the mic feedback.[nl]The song's over already!
SSR/SSR0018410
But I've got most of the controls figured out now.[nl]I should be able to manage on my own now.
RAK/RAK0058810
Really?[nl]Then let's see you put on a song and sing it.[nl]I'd like to hear your singing, too.
SSR/SSR0018420
....Who do you think you are, my mom?[nl]I said enough is enough. I refuse to sing in front of you!
RAK/RAK0058820
Aww, why not?[nl]Are you embarrassed or something?
SSR/SSR0018430
Shut up![nl]It's the first time anyone's asked me to sing![nl]So naturally I'd be nervous.
SSR/SSR0018440
I don't want anyone to hear me singing[nl]until I can practice and get better!
RAK/RAK0058830
It doesn't matter if you suck at karaoke[nl]as long as you have fun.
SSR/SSR0018450
Just get outta here already![nl]And aren't you keeping your friends waiting!?
RAK/RAK0058840
Shoot, that's right![nl]I gotta get them some drinks.
RAK/RAK0058850
Well then, enjoy your karaoke.
SSR/SSR0018460
Yeah....you were a big help. But just so you know,[nl]I think I could have managed without you.
SSR/SSR0018470
But listen up![nl]Not a word about this to anyone.
RAK/RAK0058860
Okay, okay. I understand.
SSR/SSR0018480
Not a single word!
RAK/RAK0058870
Aagh, stop that! I got it already!
