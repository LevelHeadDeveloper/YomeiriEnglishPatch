Hahh....
MRK/MRK0013430
What's wrong, Raku dearest?[nl]That was quite the sigh....
@expose
MRK/MRK0013440
Oh, the promise pendant.[nl]It's still broken, if I remember correctly....
RAK/RAK0076520
Yeah. I couldn't get at what's inside,[nl]so I had one of Shuu's friends take a look at it....
RAK/RAK0076530
And Shuu just told me that it still might take a while longer.

(A promise I made a long time ago,[nl] to marry a girl whose face I can't even remember....)
RAK/RAK0076550
(And then 10 years later, we finally meet again....[nl] The girl who has the key from back then....)
RAK/RAK0076560
(...."girls", plural, that is.)

What, you haven't gotten that pendant fixed yet?
RAK/RAK0076570
You say that like it isn't your fault.[nl]It's your fault for turning your key so hard.
CTG/CTG0023100
Ngh.... I-I'm sorry.
MRK/MRK0013450
But, until the pendant is repaired,[nl]we can't figure out which of these keys is the real one....
KSK/KSK0018110
That's right.....[nl]We know I have a key....
CTG/CTG0023110
And, um, so do I....
MRK/MRK0013460
And, most importantly, so do I. ♪
CTG/CTG0023120
Hang on! Why are you "most important"!?
MRK/MRK0013470
Everyone knows the real winner is the last to appear.[nl]And you, Kirisaki, are just a foil to set me up for success.
CTG/CTG0023130
Who's the foil here!?[nl]Kosaki, tell her what you think of that!
KSK/KSK0018120
Huhh!? I-I, umm....
MRK/MRK0013480
Kirisaki, aren't you ruled out because your key broke?
CTG/CTG0023140
Heheh. ♪　Did you forget?[nl]My key was perfectly repaired, as you can see.
MRK/MRK0013490
Mrgh....[nl]It was fixed quite well.
MRK/MRK0013500
But, Raku dearest, which of our keys do *you* think is real?[nl]Of course, you know it's mine.
RAK/RAK0076580
(Let's see....)
Tachibana has the real key
Chitoge has the real key
Onodera has the real key
I don't know
RAK/RAK0076590
Tachibana, I think you've got the real key.
MRK/MRK0013510
R - I - G - H - T!?
@ザクシャ万里花・中
CTG/CTG0023150
Rrrgh.[nl]That smug look really pisses me off....
KSK/KSK0018130
Hahaha....
RAK/RAK0076600
I'm just saying it's possible.[nl]We don't know for sure whose it is until we open it.
RAK/RAK0076610
Well, let's see....[nl]I think I'm gonna say Honey's key is the real one.
@expose2
CTG/CTG0023160
O-Ohhh. You sure know what you're talking about....
@ザクシャ千棘・中
MRK/MRK0013520
Rrrrgh....
RAK/RAK0076620
(I can feel Claude watching us through the window....!)
CLD/CLD0002520
Hmm....
RAK/RAK0076630
W-Well.... Maybe Onode--
@ザクシャ小咲・中
KSK/KSK0018140
Huh?
RAK/RAK0076640
No, definitely Honey's, yeah!
KSK/KSK0018150
H-Huh....?
CTG/CTG0023170
Oh, right?[nl]See, you know!
RAK/RAK0076650
If I knew that, we wouldn't be having any of this trouble.[nl]I'm sorry, but I honestly don't know.
MRK/MRK0013530
Hmmm, I guess.
MRK/MRK0013540
Then how about we fight for all 3 keys, winner-takes-all?
MRK/MRK0013550
We'll have a fierce battle royale,[nl]spilling blood all over the ground until[nl]someone gets all the keys!
KSK/KSK0018160
Do I have to fight too!?
RAK/RAK0076660
Hey, hey! I'll do what I can to[nl]get the pendant fixed, so calm down!
RAK/RAK0076670
Shuu's got a friend who knows how to fix it.[nl]Maybe we can work something out.
MRK/MRK0013560
Hehe. That would be fine, then.
MRK/MRK0013570
To be honest, whether or not I was the one you made the[nl]promise to, as long as I end up marrying you[nl]in the end, I'll be fine!
RAK/RAK0076680
How can you say something like that so openly....
KSK/KSK0018170
Y-Yeah.... It's amazing.
CTG/CTG0023180
I'm pretty astonished too, past the point of being appalled.
MRK/MRK0013580
If that's how you feel, you should leave my darling Raku[nl]and then he and I can get married!
CTG/CTG0023190
That's totally separate!
MRK/MRK0013590
Jeez, you're stingy....
