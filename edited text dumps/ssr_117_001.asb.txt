RAK/RAK0055370
I can hear those two from here.....
CTG/CTG0014350
Honestly, Tsugumi never gets tired of this, either.
RAK/RAK0055380
She's always chasing Shuu because he says something[nl]uncalled for, but he just never learns.[nl]Is he doing it on purpose?
WSB/WSB0000090
Hey, Ichijo, Kirisaki![nl]Can I ask you something?
@expose
RAK/RAK0055390
Hm? What is it?
WSB/WSB0000100
Is it possible that Maiko and Tsugumi are....[nl]y'know, dating?
RAK/RAK0055400
Huh!? Those two!?
CTG/CTG0014360
There's no way.
WSB/WSB0000110
But wait! Tsugumi doesn't talk to any other guys[nl]besides Ichijo and Maiko, right? So I figured they[nl]must be pretty chummy!
SYU/SYU0009230
Hohoho.... What an interesting conversation you're having.
RAK/RAK0055410
Shuu! Where'd Tsugumi go!?
SYU/SYU0009240
I shook her and came back here to hide![nl]I don't think she's going to check the classroom,[nl]so she's probably still running around the school.
RAK/RAK0055420
(This guy....[nl] He's gotten so much better at running away from Tsugumi.)
SYU/SYU0009250
Moreover, it seems there is talk amongst everyone[nl]of a relationship between Seishiro and myself.
WSB/WSB0000120
Huh? You heard that?[nl]Is it true, Maiko!?
SYU/SYU0009260
Heh..... Well, I wouldn't deny it.
CTG/CTG0014370
HUH!?!? Then it's true!?[nl]I hadn't heard anything about it from Tsugumi!
RAK/RAK0055430
Y-You're serious....?
SYU/SYU0009270
Hohoho! Completely serious!
SYU/SYU0009280
That's what I would say, but the truth is--
SSR/SSR0014980
WAAAAAAGHHHHHH!!

SYU/SYU0009290

@画面揺らし2
SSR/SSR0014990
WOULD! YOU! STOP! TELLING! LIEEEEES!?!?
SYU/SYU0009300
Gblth! I-I'b....sorry! B-But I just didn't deny it![nl]I didn't confirm it, either! So, I didn't lie!
SSR/SSR0015000
SHUT UP, YOU WON'T BE BREATHING ANYMORE!
SYU/SYU0009310
Gaack!
SSR/SSR0015010
I-It's not true! I'm not involved with this guy![nl]Okay!? Do you understand!?
WSB/WSB0000130
I see, that's too bad.
@expose
SSR/SSR0015020
Raku Ichijo!! You understand too, right!?
I understand.
Seems suspicious....
RAK/RAK0055440
Yeah. I understand.
SSR/SSR0015030
For real!? You really and truly understand!?
RAK/RAK0055450
For real. His bad jokes have gotten me[nl]a few times in the past.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
SSR/SSR0015040
I-I see.... That's good.
SSR/SSR0015050
Oh, and Mistress, please believe me![nl]This guy's basically a complete stranger to me!
CTG/CTG0014380
Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.
SSR/SSR0015060
A-Anyway....![nl]I'm not dating anyone, and I don't like anyone!
SSR/SSR0015070
No one, I tell youuuuu!
@expose2
CTG/CTG0014390
....And she's gone.
RAK/RAK0055460
Shuu, you've gone too far with this one.
SYU/SYU0009320
I-It was supposed to be a lighthearted joke....[nl]I was gonna correct it at the end....
CTG/CTG0014400
You deserved what you got.[nl]If you mess with her too much, she'll hurt you.
SYU/SYU0009330
She already did.....now.
RAK/RAK0055470
Your uneasiness makes me have my doubts.
SSR/SSR0015080
I-I told you it isn't true![nl]Believe me when I say believe me!
RAK/RAK0055480
Ah, yeah, yeah. I got it, I got it.
SSR/SSR0015090
You....don't actually believe me, do you?
RAK/RAK0055490
Huh? I-I do? I believe you?
SSR/SSR0015100
Really?
RAK/RAK0055500
R-R-Really and truly! Look at my eyes!
.......
SSR/SSR0015110
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME AT ALLLL!
@ＨＰ－１００
RAK/RAK0055510
Whyyyyy!?
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0055520
Gackh....
SYU/SYU0009340
I-It was supposed to be a lighthearted joke....[nl]I was gonna correct it at the end....
RAK/RAK0055530
(You idiot. You got me dragged into it, too.)
