RAK/RAK0040160
I'm home!
RAP/RAP0000400
Oh, you're back. That's perfect.[nl]I need to ask you a favor.
RAK/RAK0040170
Dad.... You need a favor?
RAK/RAK0040180
Don't tell there's gonna be another[nl]girlfriend or fiancee or something.
RAP/RAP0000410
Hahaha! No need to be so cautious!
RAP/RAP0000420
Actually, the Shuei-Gumi is having a little[nl]get-together with the Beehive executives pretty soon.
RAP/RAP0000430
And they'd like you to cook for them.
RAK/RAK0040190
Huh? Wait a sec.[nl]Why would they want to eat my cooking?
RAP/RAP0000440
Well, the young lady was going on and on about[nl]how good your cooking is. So they figured if it's that good,[nl]why not try it at least once?
RAK/RAK0040200
Huh? Chitoge said that?
RAP/RAP0000450
Yep. I only asked you to pretend to be dating,[nl]but it sounds like you two are pretty close anyway.
RAK/RAK0040210
T-That's not true!
RAK/RAK0040220
But, well, if she's gonna say that much,[nl]I guess I could make dinner for them.
RAP/RAP0000460
Oh, I see. Well, you'd better get moving,[nl]they'll be here tonight.
RAK/RAK0040230
Right, leave it to-
RAK/RAK0040240
Wait, tonight!?[nl]Why so soon, Dad!?
RAP/RAP0000470
It couldn't be helped.[nl]Today was the only day we could all meet.
RAP/RAP0000480
Well, you could think of it as a test of your love[nl]for your girlfriend, and give it your all.
RAK/RAK0040250
N-Ngghhh....!

RYU/RYU0001160
Young master, it's finished![nl]Whaddya need me to do next?
RAK/RAK0040260
I need you to chop the cabbage.[nl]Remember to cut with the grain, okay?[nl]It's easier to eat that way!
RYU/RYU0001170
You got it!
RAK/RAK0040270
Goddammit, I'll do it![nl]I'll make them a feast so delicious their eyeballs[nl]will pop out!
RAK/RAK0040280
Whaaat!? They're here already!?[nl]They weren't due for another two hours!
RYU/RYU0001180
Young master! Some strong allies are here to help you!
RAK/RAK0040290
Huh? Allies....?
RAK/RAK0040300
Oh, you guys!?
CTG/CTG0011680
Hello! We're here to help.
KSK/KSK0009420
It was suddenly decided there'd be a party tonight, right?
RAK/RAK0040310
Yep, that's right. But....
@expose
CTG/CTG0011690
I heard, I heard.[nl]They said they wanted to eat your cooking, right?
CTG/CTG0011700
It's pretty hard to make so much food[nl]on such short notice, so we all came to help.
SSR/SSR0010990
Ahem.... Well, it is for the Mistress, after all.[nl]If there's anything we can do, please don't hesitate to ask.
MRK/MRK0009900
It's hardly appropriate for a police commisioner's daughter[nl]to be helping out at a meeting between gangsters and[nl]yakuza.... But if it's for Raku dearest, I don't care!
RAK/RAK0040320
You guys....for me!?[nl]Thanks, I owe you all one!
RAK/RAK0040330
(Battle force analysis:....)
RAK/RAK0040340
(Judging from past experience, and from the school trip,[nl] I'd say it's something like this....)
RAK/RAK0040350
(Oh no.... It's obvious that the positives[nl] here are outweighed by the negatives....)
CTG/CTG0011710
Don't look so scared.[nl]At least we won't get in the way!
CTG/CTG0011720
Well, for now, just lighten up and[nl]let us help you!
RAK/RAK0040360
O-O-Okay....
RAK/RAK0040370
(If the guys from the Beehive get food poisoning,[nl] we can count on a war....[nl] I've gotta be careful how I divide the work....)
RAK/RAK0040380
Alright, Chitoge, you and I will bring out the food.[nl]Onodera, Ryuu, you two get the plates. Tachibana,[nl]Tsugumi, you two get your jobs from those guys over there.
CTG/CTG0011730G
Okay!
RAK/RAK0040390
Alright, Chitoge.[nl]Let's get this over with!
CTG/CTG0011740
By the way, this looks absolutely delicious.[nl]*licks lips*
RAK/RAK0040400
Don't go tasting anything without permission, okay?
CTG/CTG0011750
S-S-So rude![nl]I seriously wouldn't do that....?
RAK/RAK0040410
Why'd you end that with a question mark?[nl]Please don't. I'm serious.
CTG/CTG0011760
Yeah, yeah, I got it![nl]Mmph....
RAK/RAK0040420
Wha.... That's a lot of plates![nl]Hey, aaagh! Stop! Don't put all those on your head!
CTG/CTG0011770
Stop screaming. It'll be fine.
RAK/RAK0040430
B-Be careful, okay!?
CTG/CTG0011780
I know. Jeez!
RAP/RAP0000490
Oh, good![nl]You're helping out too, ma'am?
CTG/CTG0011790
Uh, y-yeah.
RAP/RAP0000500
I guess "wife" in "fruits of a wife's labor"[nl]refers to someone like you, huh?
RAP/RAP0000510
Hey, Raku. How about the two of you[nl]just get married already?
@キャラ揺らし
CTG/CTG0011800
----!?
RAK/RAK0040440
Gaaaaaaaaah! The fooooooood!
CTG/CTG0011810
Gaaah!? S-S-S-Sorry!
RAP/RAP0000520
Oh, sorry if I'm in the way.[nl]Let me move back again.
RAK/RAK0040450
D-Daaaadddd! We need to make this stuff[nl]all over again, dammit!
CTG/CTG0011820
I-I'm sorry....[nl]We can remake it together.
RAK/RAK0040460
(That's the one thing I can't let her do!)
RAK/RAK0040470
N-N-No, this food's not that hard to make,[nl]so don't worry about it!
RAK/RAK0040480
Besides, we've still got a lot of other things to do.[nl]Better busy than depressed! I'm counting on you, okay?
CTG/CTG0011830
....O-Okay.
RAK/RAK0040490
Alright then! Can you put the chopstick holders out[nl]for me, please? I don't have time to do it myself!
CTG/CTG0011840
Okay! Leave it to me!
RAK/RAK0040500
....Phew.[nl]Now I'd better remake that food as fast as I--
RAK/RAK0040510
Who was it this time!?
KSK/KSK0009440
Kyaah! S-S-Sorry!
RAK/RAK0040520
Huh? Onodera?
RYU/RYU0001190
Sorry, young master![nl]I was standin' behind her, an' I prob'ly startled her[nl]with my loud voice, and then....
RAK/RAK0040530
Ohh, I see. I'm sorry I shouted at you[nl]just now, Onodera.
RAK/RAK0040540
Also, you could get hurt touching those broken plates,[nl]so you don't have to worry about it. I'll have[nl]our guys clean this up!
KSK/KSK0009450
O-Okay.... I really am sorry, Ichijo![nl]And at such a busy time as this, no less....
RAK/RAK0040550
It's fine, I'm just glad you weren't hurt.
KSK/KSK0009460
Ichijo....
RYU/RYU0001200
Young master....!
RAK/RAK0040560
....What are you crying for?
RYU/RYU0001210
You really are second to no one, young master!
RYU/RYU0001220
The way you're always concerned about yer friends' safety[nl]is da absolute best!
RYU/RYU0001230
*sniff*.... I'll get these shards of glass cleaned up,[nl]so please find somethin' else for her to do, young master!
RAK/RAK0040570
S-Sure....[nl]Okay, Onodera, can you....arrange the food for me?
KSK/KSK0009470
Oh....yes![nl]I can do the arranging!
KSK/KSK0009480
Thanks, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0040580
No. I should be thanking you.
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0040590
Yeah! I've made up for the lost food!
RAK/RAK0040600
I should probably check up on the other two now.
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0040610
Tachibana. I was told you were asked to make[nl]some flower arrangements, so how's that goi--
RAK/RAK0040620
Wait, w-what is thiiiissss!?
MRK/MRK0009920
Raku dearest! Do you like it?
RAK/RAK0040630
No....d-dude. This flower arrangement is way too big![nl]It's practically breaking through the ceiling!
MRK/MRK0009930
I tried my absolute best to express my love[nl]for my darling Raku, without holding anything back. ★
MRK/MRK0009940
Now, it just needs the finishing touch....
MRK/MRK0009950
And it's all done!
RAK/RAK0040640
(Waaaaagh!? She put a plaque on it that says[nl] "HAPPY WEDDING! Raku ★ Marika"!)
RAK/RAK0040650
U-Ummm.... Tachibana?[nl]The bit that says "happy wedding" is just a little too....
RAK/RAK0040660
Wait, why are you getting closer to me!?
MRK/MRK0009960
Heheh....[nl]It's just the two of us back here, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0040670
No, everyone else is on the other side[nl]of this sliding door, right?
RAK/RAK0040680
(She slid it shut with her foot!)
MRK/MRK0009970
I just want a little....
RAK/RAK0040690
....Huh?
MRK/MRK0009980
Even if it's just for a little while,[nl]Raku dearest, I'd like to be alone with you.
MRK/MRK0009990
So, just for a little while,[nl]let me have you all to myself....
RAK/RAK0040700
Tachibana....
@画面揺らし2
SSR/SSR0011010
HEY! MARIKA TACHIBANA!
MRK/MRK0010000
Kyaaah!
SSR/SSR0011020
Stop dilly-dallying when we've got so much to do![nl]I hope you've finished the job you were given!
MRK/MRK0010010
Good grief....and we were just about to[nl]get to the good part.
SSR/SSR0011030
What are you talking about!?[nl]Raku Ichijo, the Mistress is looking for you.[nl]You'd better go see her.
RAK/RAK0040710
R-Right![nl]Tachibana, please make a *very normal*[nl]flower arrangement for me!
MRK/MRK0010020
Okay. I'll finish that up right away[nl]and then go to where you are, so please wait up for me!
RAK/RAK0040720
So, what does Chitoge need from me?[nl]Don't tell me something else happened?
SSR/SSR0011040
No, that was just a pretext.[nl]I was passing by and caught a glimpse of you,[nl]and you looked pretty stressed out.
RAK/RAK0040730
I see, you were being considerate.[nl]....Thanks, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0011050
The reason you get into situations like that so often[nl]is because you're so careless. You could stand to be[nl]a bit more careful every day.
RAK/RAK0040740
Oh, sorry....
SSR/SSR0011060
Heh. You're such a pain.
SSR/SSR0011070
By the way, do you mind if I use your washroom?[nl]I've been doing some pretty heavy work[nl]and now I'm all sweaty.
RAK/RAK0040750
Yeah, it's just through that door.[nl]Be my guest.
SSR/SSR0011080
Very well.
RAK/RAK0040760
Man, I'm sure glad you showed up, Tsugumi.[nl]I don't know what I would've done if it had[nl]just been the other three.
SSR/SSR0011090
Heh. Well, just this once,[nl]I'll admit you're in a pretty rough spot.
RAK/RAK0040770
Thanks, Tsugumi.[nl]Ya know, someone as skillful as you[nl]would make a really great wife.
RAK/RAK0040780
W-What's wrong!?
SSR/SSR0011100
....I-I'm sorry! I broke the tap!
RAK/RAK0040790
Huh!?
SSR/SSR0011110
Ghh! The water....it won't stop!
RAK/RAK0040800
Wha.... How did you break the faucet!?
SSR/SSR0011120
S-Shut up![nl]It's your own fault for saying those unnecessary things!
RAK/RAK0040810
Aaaagh, Tsugumi! You're soaked to the skin![nl]Here, use this towel!
SSR/SSR0011130
Oh, thanks....
SSR/SSR0011140
Waaaagh!? It's see-through....
RAK/RAK0040820
See-through....?[nl]Waaaagh!?
SSR/SSR0011150
DON'T LOOK AT MEEEEE!
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0040830
Glbctkh!
RAK/RAK0040840
W-Why did you have to hit me!?
SSR/SSR0011160
I-I-I-I-I'm sorry! But....[nl]Anyway, if you look at me, I'll kill you!
RAK/RAK0040850
I know! I won't look at you,[nl]even without that!
RYU/RYU0001240
Young master! The Beehive's executives[nl]get here in 20 minutes!
RAK/RAK0040860
W-Whaaaaat!?[nl]That's earlier than we planned!
RAK/RAK0040870
Tsugumi, I'm sure we have something around here[nl]similar to your clothing, so ask Ryuu if you can wear it![nl]I'm going to go finish up the final touches!
SSR/SSR0011170
G-Got it!

....What is it?[nl]You've been looking pretty worn-down[nl]these last few hours....
RAK/RAK0040900
Well....I'm just really tired....[nl]Just eat as much as you want. I'm going to go[nl]get myself a little sleep....
CTG/CTG0011850
Good work today, Raku.[nl]We're gonna go ahead and leave now.
RAK/RAK0040910
Sure.... Everyone, thanks for all your help.[nl]I should at least see you off....
KSK/KSK0009490
That's fine, Ichijo.[nl]You must be very tired, so why not go rest now?
MRK/MRK0010030
And I shall attend to you....
SSR/SSR0011180
Just go home.
MRK/MRK0010040
Aah!
CTG/CTG0011860
Okay, see you at school.
KSK/KSK0009500
See you later.

OTM/OTM0004240
Raku, thou hast finally returned!
OTM/OTM0004250
I hath been awaiting thy return![nl]Make haste and gimme some inari sushi, quick, quick!
RAK/RAK0040930
Nghh....[nl]Sorry, I can't....
OTM/OTM0004260
I have been waiting for so long! That's just cruel![nl]Inari sushiiii! Inari sushiiii!
RAK/RAK0040940
Mmmgh.... Otama, this is the only time I'll ask you for this,[nl]so please don't disturb me....
RAK/RAK0040950
I just want to sleep forever....

CTG/CTG0011870
Good morning.
SSR/SSR0011200
Good morning, everyone.
KSK/KSK0009510
Chitoge. Tsugumi. Good morning.[nl]Good work yesterday.
CTG/CTG0011880
I knew it....[nl]My darling's not here, either.
KSK/KSK0009520
What? Hey, come to think of it,[nl]you were supposed to walk with Ichijo today, right?
CTG/CTG0011890
That's right. He didn't show at our usual rendezvous point.[nl]I tried calling him and everything.
KSK/KSK0009530
I see....
MRK/MRK0010050
So he's finally tired of going to school with you, Kirisaki.[nl]Raku dearest, you naughty, naughty boy....
CTG/CTG0011900
Yeah, yeah, keep telling yourself that.
CTG/CTG0011910
Actually, it isn't just Raku,[nl]but there's something strange going on.
KSK/KSK0009540
Strange?
CTG/CTG0011920
Neither Daddy nor Claude has come back yet,[nl]even though everyone else who attended the[nl]get-together yesterday has.
KSK/KSK0009550
Huh!? Really!?
SSR/SSR0011210
Yes. I tried contacting Master Claude, but I couldn't[nl]get through to him over the regular phone, much less over[nl]the emergency hotline....
KSK/KSK0009560
Could it be that the party is still going?
CTG/CTG0011930
I don't think that's likely. And even if it was,[nl]it's still weird that we can't get in touch with them.
SSR/SSR0011220
SSR/SSR0011230
Mistress. I didn't want to even think about[nl]this possibility, but....
CTG/CTG0011940
You're saying something might have happened[nl]between the Shuei-Gumi and our guys?[nl]Well, it is possible.
CTG/CTG0011950
But if that's the case, then Darling....
SSR/SSR0011240
Yes. It's possible he got caught in the conflict....
MRK/MRK0010060
It's considered poor taste[nl]to whisper directly in front of someone.
CTG/CTG0011960
!
MRK/MRK0010070
If you have some idea what's going on,[nl]please say clearly what it is.
MRK/MRK0010080
And if Raku dearest is involved,[nl]all the more reason.
CTG/CTG0011970
Marika....
SYU/SYU0006410
What's wrong with Raku?
KSK/KSK0009570
Ruri. Maiko....
RUR/RUR0007920
Is something the matter?[nl]You all look so serious.
KSK/KSK0009580
Yeah, actually....
TLP/TLP0000010
The phone you are attempting to call is either out of range[nl]or is powered off, so it cannot be reached.
SYU/SYU0006420
How'd it go?
CTG/CTG0011980
No good. Out of range.
SSR/SSR0011250
Same with Master Claude's.[nl]There shouldn't even be anywhere where[nl]his phone wouldn't get signal.
MRK/MRK0010090G
KYK/KYK0000070
Alriiiight, everyone, get in your seats!
KYK/KYK0000080
Oh, that's unusual. Is Ichijo absent today?[nl]I haven't heard anything from him.
CTG/CTG0011990
CTG/CTG0012000
Teacher! I don't feel too well,[nl]can I leave early?
KYK/KYK0000090
Huh?
SSR/SSR0011260
Mistress!?
MRK/MRK0010100
I don't feel well either,[nl]I feel like I could collapse at any second!
SSR/SSR0011270
Ghhh! M-Me too!
SYU/SYU0006430
I've been feeling a bit feverish, too.[nl]I think I might have the flu.
RUR/RUR0007940
So obvious....
RUR/RUR0007950
Well, Kosaki? What about you?
KSK/KSK0009600
Huh!? U-Ummm....well....
KSK/KSK0009610
KSK/KSK0009620
Yes. I....I also think I have[nl]a pretty throbbing headache!
RUR/RUR0007960
Well, so do I.[nl]I'll be leaving, too.
KYK/KYK0000100
Hang on, you guys....
CTG/CTG0012010
Teacher!
KYK/KYK0000110
CTG/CTG0012020
Please....teacher!
KYK/KYK0000120
Hmmmm....
KYK/KYK0000130
I see.... Good grief.
KYK/KYK0000140
The third-period exam.
CTG/CTG0012030
Huh?
KYK/KYK0000150
It's not exactly easy for the people[nl]who make the make-up exams, either.
@expose
CTG/CTG0012040G
----!
KYK/KYK0000160
This time of year is really bad for colds.[nl]You'd all better go straight home and rest.
KYK/KYK0000170
Okay, let's get class started.
CTG/CTG0012050
Thanks a million, teacher!
KYK/KYK0000180
Of course. Give my regards to Ichijo.
CTG/CTG0012060
There's....no one coming out.
SSR/SSR0011290
It's still strange.
CTG/CTG0012070
SSR/SSR0011300
Mistress.
CTG/CTG0012080
....Yeah.
CTG/CTG0012090
Hey, everyone, listen up.
CTG/CTG0012100
It's possible there's been some kind of terrible situation[nl]between the Shuei-Gumi and the Beehive.
CTG/CTG0012110
Worst case....there may have been[nl]a gunfight in here....
CTG/CTG0012120
We don't know what kind of danger could be[nl]waiting from here on out. That's why, starting now,[nl]it'll be just me and Tsugumi....
MRK/MRK0010120
....Oh, it looks like the door's unlocked.
CTG/CTG0012130
Wha!? Marika!!
MRK/MRK0010130
Please don't underestimate me.[nl]Raku dearest may be in grave danger.
MRK/MRK0010140
If that's the case, we can't just sit around[nl]and hope the two of you sort this out.
KSK/KSK0009640
That's right! We can't let Chitoge and Tsugumi[nl]walk into danger alone.
CTG/CTG0012140
Kosaki....
SYU/SYU0006450
Alright then, let's get in there quickly.[nl]I'm worried about my best buddy, too.
RUR/RUR0007980
Then, Maiko, you can have the honor of going first.[nl]If anything happens, we can use you as a human shield.
SYU/SYU0006460
Aww, that's mean.
RUR/RUR0007990
Let's go.
KSK/KSK0009650
Yeah!
CTG/CTG0012150
You guys....
SSR/SSR0011310
I'll protect all of them.[nl]Let's get moving, Mistress.
CTG/CTG0012160
Yeah....
SYU/SYU0006470
Please pardon the intrusion.[nl]Is anyone at home?
KSK/KSK0009660
As we thought, there's no one[nl]coming to greet us.
RUR/RUR0008000
It's far to quiet for anyone to even be here.
SSR/SSR0011320
I can't smell any gunsmoke or blood, either.[nl]Doesn't seem like there was a fight....
CTG/CTG0012170
Then, what the hell happened?
MRK/MRK0010150
There's no point standing here thinking about that.[nl]We need to go investigate, right?
SYU/SYU0006480
That's right.[nl]To start with, let's go to Raku's room.
SYU/SYU0006490
....Huh?
SYU/SYU0006500
That's weird.[nl]Was Raku's room always this far of a walk?
CTG/CTG0012180
You're right....[nl]It *was* around here, wasn't it?
CTG/CTG0012190
It's a different room, after all.
SSR/SSR0011330
I don't understand.[nl]I also remember his room being somewhere around here....
KSK/KSK0009670
Hmmmm, was it this way?
MRK/MRK0010160
Huh? There's another hallway[nl]leading out from this one?
SSR/SSR0011340
This one looks like a study.
CTG/CTG0012200
Oh, in here! This is Raku's father's room![nl]But I thought this was further in....
RUR/RUR0008010
What is this....? What does this mean?
KSK/KSK0009680
The rooms are in a different order than usual?
MRK/MRK0010170
It's as though we wandered into a labryinth.
SYU/SYU0006510
Hmmm....this *is* pretty bad.[nl]Shall we go back the way we came?
SSR/SSR0011350
No, it doesn't look like it'll be that simple.[nl]The room behind us is already different than before....
SYU/SYU0006520
Eek!?
RUR/RUR0008020
That's impossible!
SSR/SSR0011360
Yep. Something like this just doesn't happen normally....![nl]It could be a mass hallucination....or maybe real magic....
KSK/KSK0009690
Anyway, does that mean we can't go home anymore?
SYU/SYU0006530
Hmmm.... This is a problem....
CTG/CTG0012210
In any case, let's try to find Raku and the others first, okay?[nl]Maybe they're also wandering around in here,[nl]trying to get out.
KSK/KSK0009700
....Yeah, sounds good.[nl]If we keep walking around, we might run across[nl]Ichijo's room at some point.
MRK/MRK0010180
Of course we should.[nl]Otherwise, there won't have been a point in coming here.
SSR/SSR0011370
Then everyone, stick close to me.[nl]If we get separated in here, it's very possible[nl]we might never meet up again.
CTG/CTG0012220
Got it. Everyone![nl]Let's move as a group!
KSK/KSK0009710G
Okay.
CTG/CTG0012230
Aaargh, goddamn it all![nl]No matter how much we walk,[nl]we can't find my darling's room!
SSR/SSR0011380
My cell phone's been out of service range[nl]for a while now, and I'm feeling weak....
CTG/CTG0012240
Dammit! I'm so hungry![nl]I don't even care about getting to Raku's room now,[nl]I just want to get to the kitchen!
KSK/KSK0009720
Chitoge....
MRK/MRK0010200
That goes to show just how little you really love[nl]Raku dearest. I'm honestly disappointed.
CTG/CTG0012250
Shaddup! We can't do battle on an empty stomach!
RUR/RUR0008040
Okay, so let's take a break when we get to the next room.[nl]I'm tired from all this walking.
SYU/SYU0006550
Sounds good. Alright, I'm opening the door.
RUR/RUR0008050
Oh. This is....
KSK/KSK0009730
This is that inari shrine we visited that one time....right?
CTG/CTG0012260
Oh. Where are we....?
SSR/SSR0011390
This is the neighborhood inari shrine.[nl]I've seen it while patrolling the town.
CTG/CTG0012270
Yeeeeeaaaaahh!
MRK/MRK0010210
Kyaaah! W-What's this!?[nl]Why did you suddenly yell so loudly....?
CTG/CTG0012280
FOOOOOOD!
MRK/MRK0010220
Huh!?
CTG/CTG0012290
Everyone! Look, look![nl]There's a lot of inari sushi here!
RUR/RUR0008060
Chitoge. I'm pretty sure those are[nl]offerings for the inari-sama....
SYU/SYU0006560
But if we just leave it, we'll all starve to death,[nl]so a little bad-luck curse can't be helped at this point.
SSR/SSR0011400
That's right. Right now,[nl]our top priority is to survive.
MRK/MRK0010230
One, two, three....[nl]There's exactly six of these.
KSK/KSK0009740
They look delicious.[nl]Almost like Ichijo made them....
CTG/CTG0012300
Then, with thanks to the gods....
CTG/CTG0012310G
Let's eat!
OTM/OTM0004290
STOOOOOOPPPPP!
CTG/CTG0012320G
Aaagh!
OTM/OTM0004310
I shan't share my inari sushi with anyone!
OTM/OTM0004300
Hahh! Hahh! Hahhhh!
CTG/CTG0012330
W-W-W-Whaaat!?
SYU/SYU0006590
A child!?
RUR/RUR0008090
So there's other people here besides us.
SSR/SSR0011430
But I've never seen this child before,[nl]in either the Beehive or the Shuei-Gumi.
MRK/MRK0010260
It's strange that there's a child here[nl]to begin with. And are those....cat ears?
OTM/OTM0004320
I am NOT A CHILD! And these are not cat ears![nl]They're FOX EARS!
SYU/SYU0006600
Ooh, you're so cute, and you've even got a tail![nl]You're good at cosplaying, aren't you.
RUR/RUR0008100
Don't go touching that little girl, Maiko.
SYU/SYU0006610
I wasn't going to.[nl]You really don't have any faith in me at all.
OTM/OTM0004330
Hey, listen to me![nl]My name is Otama. What art thou all doing here?
CTG/CTG0012340
Well.... We were just looking for Raku....[nl]Er, looking for *someone*....
OTM/OTM0004340
So thou art looking for Raku?
CTG/CTG0012350
Huh!? So you know who he is!?
OTM/OTM0004350
Mhm, of course I knoweth of him![nl]Right now, Raku is fast asleep.
MRK/MRK0010270
Asleep....what does that mean?[nl]Is there something the matter with his health?
KSK/KSK0009770
And Ichijo's house is like a maze now....[nl]What on earth is going on here?
KSK/KSK0009780
....This is all just so confusing.[nl]I'm sorry for asking such a confusing question, big sister.
OTM/OTM0004360
There isn't anything wrong with his health.[nl]He told me that he was tired and wanted to sleep,[nl]so I made it so that he could sleepeth forever.
OTM/OTM0004370
Also, the reason his house is like a maze[nl]is so that those who could disturb his sleep[nl]cannot reacheth him very easily.
CTG/CTG0012360
....H-Hmm? What does that mean, exactly?[nl]I don't really understand.
OTM/OTM0004380
As a senko, I useth magic that humans cannot![nl]That is how I am making him sleep.
CTG/CTG0012370
...Huh? Senko?
OTM/OTM0004390
It's the character "sen" from "sennin (hermit)", with the[nl]kanji for "fox" (read "ko")! It's an existence above that[nl]of a youko (fox spirit).... Doth thou yet understand?
SSR/SSR0011440
So you're saying you're not a human.
CTG/CTG0012380
What the hell? That's kinda suspicious.[nl]Are you really using powers that humans can't?
OTM/OTM0004400
I-It is sacreligious to say it's suspicious![nl]Go on, make a wish and I'll grant it for thee!
SYU/SYU0006620
Well, could you summon a super-cute girl right here? ★
OTM/OTM0004410
Yeah, of course. Leave it to me!
CTG/CTG0012390
Wait just a minute.[nl]What exactly are you gonna do with that?
SYU/SYU0006630
Huh? No good?[nl]I thought it would be a pretty simple wish.
CTG/CTG0012400
What's simple about that?[nl]Alright, how about this one:
CTG/CTG0012410
I want you to serve me the best ramen ever made!
KSK/KSK0009790
Huh!?
SYU/SYU0006640
Maaan, Kirisaki, I gotta say your wish is[nl]also pretty close to your base desires....
MRK/MRK0010280
I have to agree with that statement.
CTG/CTG0012420
Shut up!
OTM/OTM0004420
Thou art sure about wanting ramen?[nl]Or perhaps thou wouldst prefer the beautiful woman[nl]after all?
CTG/CTG0012430
The ramen! Everyone's hungry, right?[nl]Please make enough for everyone!
OTM/OTM0004430
Yes, of course!
@画面揺らし
CTG/CTG0012440G
CTG/CTG0012450
Huh!? Ramen actually appeared!
CTG/CTG0012460
*slurp* *slurp* ....D-Delicious![nl]Hey, guys! You gotta try this!
SSR/SSR0011460
Huh!? M-M-M-Mistress![nl]At least let me check it for poison first....

KSK/KSK0009810
*slurp* *chew chew*[nl]I wouldn't have thought you could[nl]make ramen this good, Otama!
MRK/MRK0010300
I suppose if I want to find Raku dearest[nl]I'll have to eat.
MRK/MRK0010310
Fffff.... *nom nom*[nl]Oh my, this really is delicious! ♪
SYU/SYU0006660
Ahhh, it's spreading throughout my whole body.[nl]Otama, get me a refill!
OTM/OTM0004450
Right!
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0012470
Ahhh, I'm so full![nl]That was absolutely delicious![nl]Now I know your magic is for real.
OTM/OTM0004460
Hehehe. I'm glad thou enjoyed it.[nl]That makes me happy.★
KSK/KSK0009820
Ummm.... So, Ichijo's sleeping right now?[nl]Will he be coming to school tomorrow?
OTM/OTM0004470
No, that is impossible.[nl]Raku's wish was to "sleep forever,[nl]without being disturbed by anyone".
SSR/SSR0011510
Huh? So you mean he'll just keep sleeping forever....?
OTM/OTM0004480
Mhm.
RUR/RUR0008140
He'll never wake up for the rest of his life?
OTM/OTM0004490
Correct.
MRK/MRK0010320
No....![nl]If Raku dearest doesn't wake up, that's a big problem!
CTG/CTG0012480
T-That's right. And it's totally obvious[nl]he was speaking figuratively when he said "forever"!
CTG/CTG0012490
How do we wake up Raku!?[nl]Tell me, you STUPID FOX!
@キャラ揺らし
OTM/OTM0004500
S-Stopppp![nl]Don't shaketh me so roughly!
OTM/OTM0004510
H-Hmmmm.... How to wake up Raku....
KSK/KSK0009830
Otama, you're a goddess who grants wishes, right?[nl]Wouldn't it be enough to just wish that he'd wake up?
OTM/OTM0004520
'Tis complicated. Basically, wishes made earlier[nl]taketh precedence, unless it was the same person[nl]who made the other wish.
OTM/OTM0004530
However, if thou truly wanteth this,[nl]it isn't impossible. Thou must go through the[nl]appropriate rituals and be prepared for the risks.
CTG/CTG0012500
What rituals, exactly?
OTM/OTM0004540
There's no specific ritual for this.[nl]As long as it involves someone who truly loves Raku[nl]pouring their feelings into his body, anything is fine....
SYU/SYU0006670
Then how about a kiss?[nl]Raku seems like Sleeping Beauty right now, after all.
CTG/CTG0012510
Huh? What are you--
OTM/OTM0004550
Ooh! Good idea![nl]That's perfect!
CTG/CTG0012520G
OTM/OTM0004560
The shrine's door doth lead to Raku's room.[nl]Thou may open it and go through at thy leisure.
CTG/CTG0012530
I-It's been settled just like that!?
CTG/CTG0012540
Hey....Maiko!!
SSR/SSR0011530
Yeah! Why are you always[nl]doing these unnecessary things!?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0006680
Yaaaaaaargh!?
RUR/RUR0008150
He really is a hopeless man....
KSK/KSK0009850
Hey, Otama.[nl]There really isn't any other way?
OTM/OTM0004570
The ritual has already been decided.[nl]It cannot be changed now.
SSR/SSR0011540
Dammit....![nl]What an annoying decision this--
SSR/SSR0011550
Wait, Marika Tachibana!?
KSK/KSK0009860
She's gone through the door already!
CTG/CTG0012550
Hey, Marika![nl]Wait up!
SSR/SSR0011560
M-Mistress! Please wait!
KSK/KSK0009870
Huh? G-Guys!?[nl]W-What should I do!?
RUR/RUR0008160
Go on, you get in there, too![nl]If you don't hurry up, you'll regret it later!
KSK/KSK0009880
Ruri....
KSK/KSK0009890
....Okay, I will.[nl]I'll go!!
RUR/RUR0008170
Jeez, she's such a pain.
SYU/SYU0006690
"Raku will be awakened by a kiss from someone who truly[nl]loves him." ....That's what Otama said, and if it's true,[nl]then we have no business going in there, huh.
SYU/SYU0006700
Ruri, shall we wait out here together?
RUR/RUR0008180
----
SYU/SYU0006710
Huh? Am I just imagining it,[nl]or do you look really unhappy right now?
RUR/RUR0008190
You're not imagining it, I really am.
SYU/SYU0006720
Aww, that's mean.
RUR/RUR0008200
And whose fault is it?
OTM/OTM0004580
Well then, I suppose I'll be going, too.
SYU/SYU0006730
Where are you going?
OTM/OTM0004590
To give the four of them a test.
RUR/RUR0008210
A test!? You never mentioned anything like that!
OTM/OTM0004600
No, did I not tell thee?[nl]There is a certain amount of danger involved[nl]in undoing someone else's wish.
OTM/OTM0004610
The test itself shall be over soon.[nl]Please wait out here for the results.
SYU/SYU0006740
RUR/RUR0008220

MRK/MRK0010330
Huh? Where am I....?
CTG/CTG0012560
Where am I!?[nl]Wasn't this supposed to go to Raku's room!?
SSR/SSR0011570
What's going on....?
KSK/KSK0009900
Ichijo! Guys![nl]Where are you all!?
OTM/OTM0004620
Well then, let the test begin.
CTG/CTG0012570G
@rak_006_010
OTM/OTM0004630
I am the divine fox spirit[nl]who granteth wishes....
OTM/OTM0004640
Thou must all prove that thy wish to wake up Raku[nl]is stronger than his wish to sleep forever[nl]without disturbance.
OTM/OTM0004650
Those who fail this test....will also succumb to[nl]Raku's wish, and shall sleep forever with him.
OTM/OTM0004660
No one else can hear what thou sayeth here.[nl]So face these trials with confidence and sincerity.
OTM/OTM0004670
Alright, let us begin!
OTM/OTM0004680
A question for thee, Chitoge Kirisaki.
OTM/OTM0004690
Why dost thou want to wake up Raku?
Why wake up Raku?
For Raku's own sake
Because I want him awake
CTG/CTG0012580
Well, because I'm sure Raku would also want to[nl]be awake right now.
CTG/CTG0012590
There's no way he'd seriously wish[nl]to sleep forever.
OTM/OTM0004700
That's a lot of confidence in thy words.
OTM/OTM0004710
But isn't it also largely thy fault[nl]that Raku is so tired?
OTM/OTM0004720
Thou art often hitting and abusing him, correct?
You often hit him?
How'd you know that!?
That's not true!
OTM/OTM0004730
I told thee. I'm a fox spirit.
OTM/OTM0004740
It probably escaped thy notice,[nl]but I have been watching thee for some time.
OTM/OTM0004750
Well, from a normal standpoint, it is pretty stressful[nl]to be with someone so violent.
OTM/OTM0004760
Would it not be a greater service[nl]to simply let him sleep?
Why not let him sleep?
You've got a point....
That's up to Raku.
CTG/CTG0012600
That's....not something we can decide.
CTG/CTG0012610
Only he knows how he really feels about any of this.[nl]I don't even know for sure if being with me[nl]causes him stress....
CTG/CTG0012620
So it's just not right to assume[nl]he wants to stay asleep.
OTM/OTM0004770
Then how is it right to assume he wanteth to wake up?
CTG/CTG0012630
Hehe.... You're right.[nl]Let's stop playing with words.
CTG/CTG0012640
Maybe I don't know how Raku feels about this.
CTG/CTG0012650
But I do know how I feel about it.
CTG/CTG0012660
I want Raku to wake back up!
OTM/OTM0004780
I understandeth well thy wish.
OTM/OTM0004790
A question for thee, Kosaki Onodera.
OTM/OTM0004800
I'm lonely without Ichijo
It's natural as a friend
KSK/KSK0009920
Without Ichijo....I'm lonely.
KSK/KSK0009930
If I were to lose all contact with him....[nl]I don't....want to....
OTM/OTM0004810
I agree. I feeleth the same way.
OTM/OTM0004820
It saddens me that I shall never again[nl]eat the inari sushi he makes.
OTM/OTM0004830
What food does he maketh that thou shalt miss?[nl]Japanese food? Dessert of some kind?
What is it?
That's not what I meant
Japanese sweets
OTM/OTM0004840
Hmm? It wasn't his food?
OTM/OTM0004850
Then why dost thou not want to lose contact with him?
KSK/KSK0009940
Um, well....
KSK/KSK0009950
Meeting him, and talking with him....[nl]That alone made me so happy....
OTM/OTM0004860
Hmmm, I'm not sure I understand....
OTM/OTM0004870
In short, thou art happy simply from[nl]being in contact with him.
OTM/OTM0004880
But....that feeling is one-sided.
KSK/KSK0009960
OTM/OTM0004890
Thou hast not noticed?[nl]Then let me tell thee.
OTM/OTM0004900
I hath seen thou speaking with Raku a few times....
OTM/OTM0004910
And Raku kept looking away from thee.
OTM/OTM0004920
That means he doesn't want to look at thee too much.[nl]Is that not correct?
Is Raku avoiding you?
That's not true
W-Well....
KSK/KSK0009970
Otama. That's not true.
KSK/KSK0009980
Maybe I don't know what Ichijo[nl]thinks of me personally. But....
KSK/KSK0009990
Ichijo is really kind to me regardless.
KSK/KSK0010000
At the Culture Festival, he did Romeo and Juliet[nl]with me, even though I couldn't be in the official play....
KSK/KSK0010010
And when I passed my high school entrance exam,[nl]he was really happy for me.
KSK/KSK0010020
No matter how good a person someone is, I don't think[nl]they'd be that nice to someone they don't even want to see.
KSK/KSK0010030
So I trust in Ichijo.
KSK/KSK0010040
And because I trust in him....[nl]I want to meet with him so much more,[nl]and talk with him a lot!
OTM/OTM0004930
OTM/OTM0004940
A question for thee, Seishiro Tsugumi.
OTM/OTM0004950
Why dost thou want to wake up Raku?
I made a promise
I'm on a mission
SSR/SSR0011590
You see....I made a promise to the Mistress.
SSR/SSR0011600
Ten years ago, I swore to her that I would[nl]become a strong person, capable of protecting her.
SSR/SSR0011610
Raku Ichijo is her boyfriend.[nl]How can I be called someone who can protect her[nl]if I can't even save her lover?
OTM/OTM0004960
Mhm, mhm. But that's just logic.
SSR/SSR0011620
What?
OTM/OTM0004970
What about thine own feelings?[nl]Dost thou want to wake him up?
How do you feel?
I want to wake him up
That doesn't matter
SSR/SSR0011630
I....want to wake him up.
SSR/SSR0011640
Raku Ichijo, um.... He isn't a bad guy.[nl]Over the course of my mission, I came to realize that.
SSR/SSR0011650
If I just left him like this,[nl]it would weigh on my conscience....
SSR/SSR0011660
And that's, well....umm....the truth.
OTM/OTM0004980
Thou art not making thyself clear.[nl]Art thou hiding something?
SSR/SSR0011670
I-I'm not hiding anything....![nl]I definitely don't have any special feelings for him!
OTM/OTM0004990
How suspicious.
OTM/OTM0005000
This is a very important test.[nl]If thou liest, thou shalt be disqualified.
SSR/SSR0011680
....!?
OTM/OTM0005010
I shall ask once more.
OTM/OTM0005020
Thou hath told me that thou hath no[nl]special feelings for him, is that true?
SSR/SSR0011690
OTM/OTM0005030
Art thou in love with Raku Ichijo thyself?
SSR/SSR0011700
W-Well....
Do you love Raku?
I love him
I don't love him
OTM/OTM0005040
Thy silence is thy answer.
SSR/SSR0011710
Huh?
OTM/OTM0005050
Thou hast endured well without lying.
OTM/OTM0005060
Thy feelings have been well conveyed to me.
SSR/SSR0011720
OTM/OTM0005070
A question for thee, Marika Tachibana.
OTM/OTM0005080
Why doth thou want to wake up Raku?
Because I love Raku dearest
MRK/MRK0010350
There's no reason to even ask![nl]It's because I love Raku dearest!
MRK/MRK0010360
It's only natural to want to be[nl]with the person you love!
OTM/OTM0005090
I see. What a clear answer.
OTM/OTM0005100
However, it is also true that Raku wished[nl]to sleep forever.
OTM/OTM0005110
Would it not be more loving of thee[nl]to let him have his wish?
MRK/MRK0010370
It would be. That is, if that's what he really wants.
OTM/OTM0005120
How about this? I'll put the two of you[nl]alone in a dream world.
OTM/OTM0005130
You could be alone with Raku forever,[nl]with no one to disturb you.
You want that?
That sounds wonderful!
It would be meaningless
MRK/MRK0010380
No, thank you. It would all be meaningless[nl]in a dream world.
OTM/OTM0005140
Is that right? I don't think there's much difference[nl]between a dream world and reality....
MRK/MRK0010400
I don't want to just indulge in happy fantasies.[nl]I want to be united with Raku dearest in the real world.
OTM/OTM0005150
Hmmm. Why art thou so obsessed with reality?
Why indeed?
Because reality is fun
I want to use my own power[nl]to make Raku dearest mine
MRK/MRK0010410
Right now, Raku dearest has his own lover.
MRK/MRK0010420
But I have decided to steal Raku dearest from her,[nl]without running away from the situation.
MRK/MRK0010430
If I used your power to help me with that....
MRK/MRK0010440
I'm sure I'd feel guilty for what I did to both[nl]Raku dearest and myself.
MRK/MRK0010450
So I refuse.[nl]I'll win Raku's heart myself, with my own power!
OTM/OTM0005160
OTM/OTM0005170
One last question, for all of thee.
OTM/OTM0005185
What kind of person is Raku Ichijo to you?
OTM/OTM0005190
I understand.
MRK/MRK0010460
Huh?
CTG/CTG0012670
We're in Raku's room....!?
KSK/KSK0010050
Does that mean the test is over?
SSR/SSR0011730
!![nl]Mistress! Over there!
CTG/CTG0012680G
Raku!
KSK/KSK0010070
Thank goodness....[nl]We finally found him....
MRK/MRK0010480
He looks well, I'm so relieved.
CTG/CTG0012690
You have no idea how worried I was....
CTG/CTG0012700
HEEYYY! Sleepyhead![nl]Wake up already!
CTG/CTG0012710
Huh?
SSR/SSR0011740
Hey! Raku Ichijo![nl]How dare you not respond to the Mistress's call!?[nl]Get up at once!
SSR/SSR0011750
Hm....!?
MRK/MRK0010490
Raku dearest. You can get up now, okay?[nl]Raku dearest?
KSK/KSK0010080
That's strange. We've tried so many times,[nl]but he still won't wake up.
CTG/CTG0012720
Does that mean he's still under Otama's spell?
MRK/MRK0010500
Oh! That's right![nl]Raku dearest still needs the kiss from someone[nl]who truly loves him!
CTG/CTG0012730
....Oh, you're right.[nl]I remember hearing something like that.
MRK/MRK0010510
In that case, I'll just go ahead[nl]and give him his kiss!
CTG/CTG0012740
Whaa!? Marika, stop!
MRK/MRK0010520
Please let me do it![nl]Don't try to stop me!
OTM/OTM0005200
What art thou arguing for?[nl]Just do it already.
KSK/KSK0010090
Otama!
OTM/OTM0005210
I can see now that thou all have genuine feelings for him.[nl]Any one of you will do. Just kiss him.
KSK/KSK0010100
Any of us, you say....
MRK/MRK0010530
Then why can't it be me!?
CTG/CTG0012750
Shut up! Just be quiet for a minute!
SSR/SSR0011760
T-Then, why don't you do it, Mistress?[nl]Umm....you are his....girlfriend, after all....
CTG/CTG0012760
Huh!? Me!?[nl]Uh, um, WHAAAAAAAAT!?
CTG/CTG0012770
N-N-N-No way!?[nl]Not with so many people here!
MRK/MRK0010540
Let me, let meeee!
CTG/CTG0012780
OTM/OTM0005220
Thou may kiss him anywhere, so hurry up.
CTG/CTG0012790G
CTG/CTG0012800
Anywhere?
OTM/OTM0005230
Of course. Whatever thy fancy.[nl]His hands, his buttocks, his stomach, whatever.
OTM/OTM0005240
And while we're at it, thou may all do it at the same time.[nl]The important thing is to put thy feelings for him into it.
CTG/CTG0012810
Alright, everyone, let's get to it.
KSK/KSK0010120
....Right.
MRK/MRK0010550
It can't be helped.
SSR/SSR0011780
CTG/CTG0012820
One, two, three....!
RAK/RAK0040990
....Mmph....
CTG/CTG0012830G
RAK/RAK0041000
Yaaaaaawnnn....[nl]What an amazing sleep....
RAK/RAK0041010
....Wait, aaagh![nl]What are you all doing in here!?
CTG/CTG0012840
R-Raku....[nl]You're awake?
RAK/RAK0041020
?[nl]Well....obviously.
CTG/CTG0012850
Hahhh.....[nl]Don't ever make me worry like that again,[nl]stupid bean sprout!
KSK/KSK0010140
I'm so relieved....[nl]I thought you were never going to wake up.
RAK/RAK0041030
....Huh?
MRK/MRK0010570
Raku dearesssstt![nl]I've woken you up with my love!
RAK/RAK0041040
Gaaaah!? T-Tachibana!? Get away!
SSR/SSR0011800
RAK/RAK0041050
Hm? What's wrong, Tsugumi?[nl]Your face is all red....
SSR/SSR0011810
S-S-S-S-Shut up![nl]It's your fault to begin with....
SYU/SYU0006750
Yoo-hoo![nl]Is Sleeping Beauty awake yet?
RAK/RAK0041060
Shuu!? And Miyamoto, too!?
RUR/RUR0008230
Seems like everything's worked out.
RUR/RUR0008240
We passed by the others on our way here.[nl]Seems like the spell on the house has been completely lifted.
SYU/SYU0006760
Hey, hey, now spill![nl]Who ended up doing the kissing!?
CTG/CTG0012860G
RAK/RAK0041070
Spell? Kissing?
CTG/CTG0012870
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!
SYU/SYU0006770
Glbctkhlbctkh!
SSR/SSR0011830
TAKE THISSSSS!
SYU/SYU0006780
Gackkhh!
RAK/RAK0041080
Waaagh!? Shuu!?
CTG/CTG0012880
You! This is your fault!!
SSR/SSR0011840
You! This is your fault!!
KSK/KSK0010160
H-Hey! You two!
RUR/RUR0008250
Leave it alone, Kosaki.[nl]He got what he deserved.
MRK/MRK0010580
Hehehe. I'm grateful to Maiko.
RAK/RAK0041090
Uhhh....
RAK/RAK0041100
Hey, Otama. I have no idea what's going on here....[nl]What the hell happened?
OTM/OTM0005250
Mhm. For starters--
@rak_006_020
RAK/RAK0041110
Thank you so much for today. If it hadn't been[nl]for you guys, I don't know what I would've done.
CTG/CTG0012890
....Well, I guess that's good, right?[nl]After school tomorrow, we're getting ramen, your treat!
RAK/RAK0041120
Alright, leave it to me!
KSK/KSK0010170
See you later, Ichijo.
MRK/MRK0010590
See you at school.
SSR/SSR0011850
Try not to oversleep this time.
RAK/RAK0041130
Right. See you all at school!
RAK/RAK0041140
Hahh.... You've really messed up this time.[nl]And was it really okay to show yourself in front of[nl]all of them?
OTM/OTM0005260
'Tis fine. I hath cast a spell on them such that[nl]they will forget everything by the time they get home.
RAK/RAK0041150
You can do that, too....?
OTM/OTM0005270
Still, thou art quite the playboy.[nl]To have that many young ladies at thine age....
RAK/RAK0041160
Don't make fun of me.[nl]Anyway, the only one who actually said she likes me[nl]is Tachibana.
OTM/OTM0005280
Is that really what thou believeth?
RAK/RAK0041170
Huh? What do you mean?
OTM/OTM0005290
OTM/OTM0005300
Well, well, it seems as though even without my sleep spell,[nl]thine eyes are still not open.
RAK/RAK0041180
What are you talking about?[nl]Say it in a way I can understand.
OTM/OTM0005310
Hey, Raku....no matter what thou believeth, in the future,[nl]thou canst only choose one woman.[nl]That's how it normally goes.
OTM/OTM0005320
However, if thou so chooseth, I can make it[nl]so that thou doth not have to choose between them.
RAK/RAK0041190
OTM/OTM0005330
Thou hast been a great help to me.[nl]I have eaten countless inari sushi.[nl]So I would be more than happy to return that favor.
OTM/OTM0005340
How about it? Everyone will love thee,[nl]and everyone will be with thee. Thou will not have to choose[nl]just one.
OTM/OTM0005350
Wouldst thou like to have such a future?
RAK/RAK0041200
Well....
I don't want that.
Sounds good to me!
@rak_006_true
RAK/RAK0041210
Thanks for offering,[nl]but I'd rather not do that.
RAK/RAK0041220
This is a choice I need to make for myself.[nl]I won't be needing your power.
OTM/OTM0005360
I see. So it's not as though[nl]thou doth not need my power.
OTM/OTM0005370
But to choose thine own future....[nl]Is that thy wish?
RAK/RAK0041230
Yep. That's right.
OTM/OTM0005380
I see....
OTM/OTM0005390
Then thy wish shall be granted.
RAK/RAK0041240
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0041250
Otama....![nl]Your tails....!
OTM/OTM0005400
Ooh!
OTM/OTM0005410
I see, Raku.[nl]So this wish was made from thy heart....
OTM/OTM0005420
And it was a truly noble wish,[nl]one that would not cause harm to anyone....
OTM/OTM0005430
I am grateful. Thanks to thee,[nl]I was able to achieve my goal.
OTM/OTM0005440
Therefore, I must leave now.
RAK/RAK0041260
Huh!? Why so suddenly!?[nl]You're really gonna leave?
OTM/OTM0005450
Mhm. When a wish is granted, one that bringeth[nl]everybody happiness, the youko who granted it[nl]will grow and be closer to becoming a senko.
OTM/OTM0005460
However, only one such wish counteth per person.[nl]I must search for another person with a wish.
OTM/OTM0005470
So, I must bid thee farewell.
RAK/RAK0041270
I-Is that right?[nl]This is all rather sudden....
RAK/RAK0041280
But, take care out there.
OTM/OTM0005480
Mm. Same to thee.
OTM/OTM0005490
Thy inari sushi truly was delicious.[nl]It makes me sad that I shall never again[nl]taste it.
RAK/RAK0041290
Don't worry. I'll make lots more[nl]and bring them to the shrine as offerings.
OTM/OTM0005500
Hehe. That's great.[nl]By all means.
RAK/RAK0041300
OTM/OTM0005510
But that is a wish that may never be granted.
OTM/OTM0005520
Once this conversation is over, thou shalt loseth[nl]all memories of me, just like the girls.
OTM/OTM0005530
It is, well, kind of the rule.[nl]But for thee, O he who maketh his own way in this world,[nl]there should be no problem with that.
OTM/OTM0005540
Well then, Raku, please take care.[nl]'Twas fun, even if only for a short while.
RAK/RAK0034160
Mm.....mph....
@pro_001_01
RAK/RAK0041310
Well, whatever.[nl]I don't really understand, but....
RAK/RAK0041320
I wish we can all continue to have a fun[nl]and fulfilling high school life.
RAK/RAK0041330
Alright, I'd better go. If I'm late to meet[nl]Chitoge, she'll knock me into lower orbit. 
RAK/RAK0041340
See you around, gods.

RAK/RAK0041410
Mmmphh....
RAK/RAK0041420

RAK/RAK0041430
What's this? There's something moving around[nl]in my futon....
MRK/MRK0010600
Hehehe. Good morning, Raku dearest. ★
RAK/RAK0041440
Marika? What are you doing in there?
MRK/MRK0010610
I came to ask if I could eat breakfast with you[nl]every day from now on. ★
RAK/RAK0041450
Hmmmm. Well, that's okay with me.
MRK/MRK0010620
Thank you so much!
MRK/MRK0010630
Okay, Raku dearest, say "aah". ★
RAK/RAK0041460
Aaaah. ★
RYU/RYU0001250
Woweee, young master, yer not to be underestimated![nl]Havin' a mistress at his young age,[nl]I can't wait to see what happens in the future!
RAK/RAK0041470
Well, I am in high school already, after all.[nl]I do have to keep improving myself as a man.
RYU/RYU0001260
Yeah, young master, yer so right![nl]Hooray! Young master! Whatta stud!
MRK/MRK0010640
Well, Raku dearest? Did that taste good?
RAK/RAK0041480
Yeah, it was delicious.[nl]Your cooking is the best, Mari.
MRK/MRK0010650
Yaaay! I'm so happy!
RAK/RAK0041490
Hahaha.
KSK/KSK0010210
Hey, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0041500
Oh, what is it, Kosaki?
KSK/KSK0010220
Umm.... If you're okay with it,[nl]would you like to work part-time at the shop again?
RAK/RAK0041510
Of course. There's no way I can say no[nl]when you ask me for something, Kosaki.
KSK/KSK0010230
Thanks!
@expose
KSK/KSK0010240
So, that day....actually, my mom[nl]won't be home that day.
RAK/RAK0041520
Huh?
KSK/KSK0010250
I was thinking....it might be nice[nl]if you could stay over in my room that day.
RAK/RAK0041530
Oooh....
RAK/RAK0041540
Sounds good. I'm looking forward to it.
SSR/SSR0011860
Good morning, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0041550
Oh, Tsugumi. Good morning.
SSR/SSR0011870
Actually, ummm....[nl]I'd like to give you this, if you don't mind.
RAK/RAK0041560
Hey, are you summoning me for a duel?[nl]Gimme a break, would ya?
SSR/SSR0011880
Of course I'm not![nl]Ghh.... You know what this is.
SSR/SSR0011890
....This is a love letter I wrote for you.
RAK/RAK0041570
Ohhh, I love it![nl]Thank you, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0011900
You love it....
SSR/SSR0011910
I-I see. Then I'll write one for you every day.[nl]Of course, you shouldn't feel obligated to write back.
KSK/KSK0010260
Wowww, that sounds great![nl]Maybe I can write some for you too, Raku?
SSR/SSR0011920
Mistress Onodera....
SSR/SSR0011930
Sounds good. Then let's write love letters[nl]to Raku Ichijo together, then give them to him.
KSK/KSK0010270
Hey, why don't we ask Chitoge and Tachibana to join us?[nl]I'm sure they'd love to write some, too!
SSR/SSR0011940
Yes, that's a great idea!
RAK/RAK0041580
(They're all going to write me love letters.[nl] Wow, I'm in heaven!)
CTG/CTG0012900
Kosaki told me about the love letters.[nl]I'll be writing you starting tomorrow,[nl]so look forward to it, okay?
RAK/RAK0041590
Right. Thanks, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0012910
H-Hey....Raku.
RAK/RAK0041600
Hm?
CTG/CTG0012920
Can I hold your hand?
RAK/RAK0041610
Oh, sure. Here, hold it as long as you like.
CTG/CTG0012930
Thanks....
CTG/CTG0012940
Listen, so me, Kosaki, and Tsugumi are all[nl]gonna wake you up tomorrow, like Tachibana did.
CTG/CTG0012950
So let's all have breakfast together then.[nl]Everyone, as friends.
RAK/RAK0041620
I see. Sounds like fun.
CTG/CTG0012960
Hey, Darling.
RAK/RAK0041630
CTG/CTG0012970
I....I want it to stay like this forever.
RAK/RAK0041640
Yes, of course, Honey.
RAK/RAK0041650
Let's stay like this forever and ever.
CTG/CTG0012980
Yes.
OTM/OTM0005570
Mhm.... good, good.[nl]Seems like they are doing well.
OTM/OTM0005580
