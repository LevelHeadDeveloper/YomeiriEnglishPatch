Wow~... I got smacked.[nl]You're pretty good.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
@ＢＧＭ再生
CTG/CTG0003270
But I won't lose next time!
RAK/RAK0001900
Oi oi, you still got spirit left, huh?
CTG/CTG0003280
Of course! We go until I win!
@ctg_003_201_02
CTG/CTG0003290
Haha, I win! How does it feel to[nl]witness my true form, Raku?
RAK/RAK0001910
Yeah, yeah, I concede.[nl]Well done, well done.
CTG/CTG0003300
Alright, then it's 1-1. Get your wallet ready, Raku.[nl]It's not over yet.
RAK/RAK0001920
We're not done yet?
CTG/CTG0003310
‘Course! We don't stop until there's a winner!
@ctg_003_201_03
CTG/CTG0003320
Let's see.... Why don't we do that next.
RAK/RAK0001930
A punching machine!?
CTG/CTG0003330
We hit the smarts, strength is next.
RAK/RAK0001940
Well, we got another straightforward one, then.
CTG/CTG0003340
With this game, you can't weasel your way out[nl]with cheap tricks, and it makes for a clean,[nl]easy to understand decider, no?
RAK/RAK0001950
I mean, it feels like you just have a[nl]massive advantage here, though....
CTG/CTG0003350
Well, I can't just be losing.[nl]Let's smack the crap out of this thing and declare me[nl]the winner already.
RAK/RAK0001960
The confidence you have of being able to[nl] "smack the crap out of this thing" is not something I'll ever[nl] hear from another girl....
CTG/CTG0003360
Hm? You say something?
RAK/RAK0001970
Nah, it's nuthin'.
CTG/CTG0003370
Kay.
CTG/CTG0003380
Alright, I'll take the first move, then.[nl]Uhh, I guess we put the coins in here?
CTG/CTG0003390
Okayyy, and I just aim for the target of the[nl]punching bag and slam it.
RAK/RAK0001980
"Top score: 158 kilograms", huh.[nl]Surprisingly, I feel like you got this in the bag.
CTG/CTG0003400
Alrighhht, then let's aim for the top, one big one.....

RAK/RAK0001990
(Woah!! She broke the IRON support beam!!??)
CTG/CTG0003420
Huh? What's "score error" mean?
CTG/CTG0003430
It keeps beeping...[nl]is the machine broken, maybe?
RAK/RAK0002000
Is it broken, more like you broke it![nl]With your brute strength!
CTG/CTG0003440
Eh......
@背景変更2
CTG/CTG0003450
Eeeeeeeh!?[nl]No way!! I hit it just like it said to!?
GCS/GCS0000010
.......Hold up! Miss, wait one sec!
CTG/CTG0003460
Gulp!
GCS/GCS0000020
Wha-..... Miss, did you do this!?
CTG/CTG0003470
Ah, uh, y-yeah, looks like it, though......[nl]Am I in trouble?
RAK/RAK0002010
A-are we going to have to pay? I'm sorry, but we[nl]aren't really carrying much right now-
GCS/GCS0000030
You're amazing!
RAK/RAK0002020G
Huh?
GCS/GCS0000040
Man, I never thought I would witness the[nl]next-age historic record of this machine!
GCS/GCS0000050
On top of that, you smashed the machine[nl]on top of the record![nl]Are you human!? You'll be a local legend!
CTG/CTG0003490
Uh, huh....
GCA/GCA0000010
Oi, check this out. It's completely nuts!
GCB/GCB0000010
A high school girl completely wrecked the machine!??
RAK/RAK0002030
(We've really drawn quite the crowd.....?)
GCS/GCS0000060
This isn't anything nuts,[nl]but take this on the house as a reward.
CTG/CTG0003500
Uh, thank you.....
GCS/GCS0000070
Also, is it cool if we take a picture of you so we can[nl]put it on the wall by the entrance?
GCS/GCS0000080
"Can you beat the legendary high school[nl]punching monster?" kinda feel. Thoughts?
CTG/CTG0003510
Ah, ahaha...... Nah....[nl]I think I'll hold off on that one.
GCB/GCB0000020
To think that beauty has that kind of strength.......[nl]Don't judge a book by its cover, I guess.
GCA/GCA0000020
Idiot, you definitely don't wanna see underneath the uniform.[nl]She's got an 8-pack for sure, man.
CTG/CTG0003520
......Hey, Raku.[nl]I don't think I can come here anymore.
RAK/RAK0002040
Hey, I get the feeling, but I really do[nl]think that's amazing, though....?
RAK/RAK0002050
At least, we can call this game your win. Don't think I can[nl] live up to the show you just put up, after all.....[nl]I'll get you that soda later.
CTG/CTG0003530
Haha, somehow.....[nl]I'm not happy with this.
CTG/CTG0003540
Why do I somehow..... feel that I lost,[nl]even though I won the game......
