Let's see, what else is good about glasses....
RUR/RUR0006770
Of course. In light of the recent craze for men with glasses,[nl]it would be easier for guys to be accepted by girls.
RUR/RUR0006780
Ichijo, I'm sure you would be more popular[nl]with the girls if you wore glasses.
Would glasses make me popular?
I'm not interested in guys with glasses
If they all look the same,[nl]it's not special anymore
You have to be attractive[nl]to begin with
RUR/RUR0006790
Even if you're not interested, Ichijo,[nl]girls might be.
RUR/RUR0006800
That's right. Kosaki might fall for a[nl]serious-looking guy with glasses, for example.
RUR/RUR0006810
Oh, did that upset you? Hehehe.

Ummmm, what else.....?

The fact that there are men without glasses is the reason[nl]that men with glasses can be so popular, you say?
RUR/RUR0006840
It's true that if all guys wore glasses,[nl]the genre wouldn't even exist....
RUR/RUR0006850
Oh, well.[nl]Ummmm, what else.....?
RUR/RUR0006860
That's a completely different thing[nl]from what I meant when I said glasses are good.
RUR/RUR0006870
But I won't say that the subject matter himself[nl]is completely irrelevant, Ichijo.
RUR/RUR0006880
What's wrong? You got quiet all of a sudden.
