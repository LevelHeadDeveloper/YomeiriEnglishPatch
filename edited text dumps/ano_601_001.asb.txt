Dude, you're soaked in sweat![nl]What happened?
RAK/RAK0063810
Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]I managed to lose Claude and his guys....
CTG/CTG0015200
Huh? But if you were coming to see me,[nl]you didn't need to go to all that trouble....
RAK/RAK0063820
Well, it's true that they won't suspect anything[nl]if it's the two of us meeting.
RAK/RAK0063830
But sometimes it might be nice if we could[nl]have a conversation without being watched.

CTG/CTG0015210
Raku....
@expose
CTG/CTG0015220
W-Well....I-I guess so.[nl]Sometimes, it might....not be so bad.
CTG/CTG0015230
Fine. I'll give you a second to catch your breath.
RAK/RAK0063840
Hehe. Thanks.

Ichijo....
RAK/RAK0063850
H-Hey, Onodera.
KSK/KSK0017270
What is it? Did you need something from me?
RAK/RAK0063860
Ummm.... I was just wondering if you[nl]wanted to walk home together sometime.
KSK/KSK0017280
Huh!? Me....?[nl]H-How come?
RAK/RAK0063870
Well, no particular reason....[nl]Would that be a problem?
@ザクシャ小咲・中
KSK/KSK0017290
Not at all! No problem at all!
KSK/KSK0017300
...W-Well then, will you be so kind as to walk me home?
RAK/RAK0063880
Why the polite tone!?
KSK/KSK0017310
Aah! Sorry, I'm just nervous.
KSK/KSK0017320
Uhh....Shall we?
RAK/RAK0063890
Yeah!
RAK/RAK0063900
(Let's walk a bit slower today....)

SSR/SSR0020230
Raku Ichijo. What are you doing here?
RAK/RAK0063910
Hahh, hahh, hahh.... I've finally managed[nl]to shake off your boss.
SSR/SSR0020240
Master Claude?[nl]Now that you mention it, he did say he was going to increase[nl]personell and strengthen your surveillance today.
SSR/SSR0020250
Heh. To think you'd be able to escape Master Claude's eyes.[nl]For you, that's quite the accomplishment.
RAK/RAK0063920
You have no idea how much effort that was....[nl]By the way, do you have some time?
SSR/SSR0020260
I don't have any immediate plans.... Why?
RAK/RAK0063930
I just managed to escape from Claude.[nl]I want to stretch my wings out a bit.
RAK/RAK0063940
If you have some time, you wanna go somewhere with me?
SSR/SSR0020270
Huh!?
SSR/SSR0020280
Y-Y-You want to go with m-m-me!?
RAK/RAK0063950
It would be boring alone, okay?
@expose2
SSR/SSR0020290
I-I-I guess that sounds okay....[nl]But are you sure you don't want someone else?
RAK/RAK0063960
I want to be able to talk to you properly sometimes.[nl]So if you don't mind, let's get going.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0020300
I-I-I see....
SSR/SSR0020310
Then it can't be helped, I'll go with you.[nl]Now that you've shaken Master Claude, I have to[nl]take his place and keep my eyes on you!
RAK/RAK0063970
Thank you, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0020320
There's no need to be thanking me.[nl]Besides, I....
RAK/RAK0063980
Hm? You what?
SSR/SSR0020330
Nothing! Let's hurry up if we're[nl]gonna go to a store or something!
SSR/SSR0020340
You're the one who invited me out.[nl]So today, I want to hear all about you.
@ano_601_mrk
MRK/MRK0011280
Oh my, Raku dearest!?[nl]You look very tired, is something the matter?
RAK/RAK0063990
No.... I was just playing some hide-and-seek.
MRK/MRK0011290
Hahh.... Is that so?
MRK/MRK0011300
But I'm glad this is where you ended up, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0064000
I came here because I saw you.
MRK/MRK0011310
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0064010
Well, I figured it might be nice to have a relaxed[nl]conversation with you occasionally....
@ザクシャ万里花・中
MRK/MRK0011320
....I never thought you'd feel this way about me.
MRK/MRK0011330
I knew it, Raku dearest, you're only dating Kirisaki because[nl]she has some kind of leverage over you and you have[nl]no choice! I can't believe it you've finally....
RAK/RAK0064020
No, no! That's not it at all!
MRK/MRK0011340
Jeez....[nl]I really wish you'd be a bit more upfront with me.
MRK/MRK0011350
But it's fine.[nl]I'm happy you came to see me regardless, Raku dearest.[nl]Let's talk a lot today.
@expose
MRK/MRK0011360
We've still got lots to talk about,[nl]both about the past, and the future.

CLD/CLD0002090
Well, well. If it isn't the Ichijo family's young master Raku.[nl]Where do you think you're going?
RAK/RAK0064030
Dammit. I'm cornered.
CLD/CLD0002100
Looks to me like you were trying to shake us.[nl]Were you, by some chance, thinking about doing something[nl]you shouldn't?
CLD/CLD0002110
Looks like we're going to have to take a few moments[nl]to thoroughly interrogate you.
CLD/CLD0002120
While we're at it, we'll also try asking about[nl]your relationship with the Mistress! Ha ha ha ha ha!
RAK/RAK0064040
(Goddammit. I should have just gone home today....)
