Hahh....I don't know what I'm gonna do.
RUR/RUR0011170
What point is there in being depressed about this?[nl]It's not like there's anything we can do.
RAK/RAK0047750
.....What's the matter?
KSK/KSK0013350
Uh....well, nothing's the matter with us,[nl]but I have this friend who's having some trouble....
RAK/RAK0047760
Trouble?
RAK/RAK0047770
....Oh, I might be butting in.[nl]Are you sure it's okay to tell me?
RUR/RUR0011180
It's fine, this isn't anyone you know.[nl]I don't think you'd be so naive as to pry about who it is.
@expose
KSK/KSK0013360
Yeah, and I'd like to hear what a boy has to say.[nl]So could you tell me what you think?
RAK/RAK0047780
Yeah, of course![nl]And don't worry, my lips are sealed!
KSK/KSK0013370
Hehe, thanks!
KSK/KSK0013380
So, um....[nl]My friend has, recently, found someone she likes.
RAK/RAK0047790
Mhm....and then?
KSK/KSK0013390
She's scared to tell him she likes him because she's fat.[nl]But she isn't actually fat.
RAK/RAK0047800
Hm? Then it sounds like there isn't a problem....
RUR/RUR0011190
Yes there is.[nl]She's completely convinced she *is* fat,[nl]so she won't believe me when I tell her she'd not.
RAK/RAK0047810
Hahh....
@expose
KSK/KSK0013400
But also.....even if she really *is* fat,[nl]she's a very nice girl, and I really want her[nl]to be honest about how she feels....
KSK/KSK0013410
But I don't know how to go about telling her....
RAK/RAK0047820
Hmmmmm, that's a tough one.
RUR/RUR0011200
So I say we just leave her alone,[nl]even if it does seem cold.
KSK/KSK0013420
I don't think that's such a good idea....[nl]Maybe the only thing we can do for her is to listen to her,[nl]but it's better than nothing.
KSK/KSK0013430
What do you think, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0047830
Let's see....
I agree with Onodera.
I agree with Miyamoto.
RAK/RAK0047840
I agree with Onodera. It's a lot easier to get people[nl]to listen to you when you show you're willing to listen.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0013440
Yeah. That sounds right.
RUR/RUR0011210
I hardly think that's very constructive....[nl]But, well, I guess that's one way to look at it.
RAK/RAK0047850
But honestly, that's very kind of you, Onodera.[nl]I can tell you were really worried for your friend.
KSK/KSK0013450
Huh?
RAK/RAK0047860
Well, you just looked so serious earlier,[nl]I thought you were worried for yourself.[nl]That's why I called out to you.
KSK/KSK0013460
I see....[nl]But, since you say that,[nl]I can tell you're kind too, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0047870
Huh, how come?
KSK/KSK0013470
Well, you thought I was having a hard time,[nl]so you came to talk to me, right? That seems[nl]very kind to me.
RAK/RAK0047880
T-That's not true....
KSK/KSK0013480
No. It totally is![nl]I guarantee it!
RAK/RAK0047890
O-Okay....[nl]Thanks a lot.
RAK/RAK0047900
(When Onodera says things like that so powerfully,[nl] that makes me so happy!)
RAK/RAK0047910
I'm with Miyamoto on this one.
RAK/RAK0047920
I understand how you feel, Onodera,[nl]but it might be best to keep some distance.
KSK/KSK0013490
I...see.....
@ザクシャるり・小
RUR/RUR0011220
Rare as it may be, I agree with you, Ichijo.[nl]That girl is under some kind of mania right now.
RAK/RAK0047930
(Mania, huh.[nl] Miyamoto sure has a harsh way of looking at things....)
KSK/KSK0013500
Ummmmm.....
RAK/RAK0047940
I-It'll be okay. She's a nice girl, right?[nl]I'm sure everything will work out.
KSK/KSK0013510
....Yeah, I guess so.[nl]I'll keep tabs on her for a bit longer.
KSK/KSK0013520
Thanks for the advice, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0047950
(I think Onodera's such a nice girl,[nl] being that compassionate for others.)
