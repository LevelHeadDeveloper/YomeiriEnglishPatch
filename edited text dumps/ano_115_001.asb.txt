Alright, the polls are nearly closed! Once we've tallied[nl]up the results, we'll broadcast them in code, so make sure[nl]you bring the deciphering key home with you!
MSA/MSA0000230
Okay, I've settled on this girl!
MSB/MSB0000190
Me too, me too! Come to think of it,[nl]all the top spots are taken by girls from class 1-C!
RAK/RAK0063220
....What's with this crowd?
SYU/SYU0012600
Ohh. Raku, you should get over here and vote, too.
RAK/RAK0063230
Vote?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0012610
"Bonyari High School's[nl]Most Beautiful Girl Contest (Fall Edition)"!
SYU/SYU0012620
A huge event just for guys, hosted by yours truly![nl]Of course, it must be kept secret from the girls!
RAK/RAK0063240
You're doing something dumb again.[nl]I don't care if they find out.
@expose
SYU/SYU0012630
Heh. You can trust me on this.[nl]You don't see any girls in the corridor right now, right?
RAK/RAK0063250
No way....[nl]That was your doing, too?
SYU/SYU0012640
Heheheh. It was a snap to handle in 5 minutes.
RAK/RAK0063260
You're sure amazing at some weird things....[nl]But the way you use that power is infinitely stupid.
SYU/SYU0012650
Well then, allow me to give you an interim report.
SYU/SYU0012660
Basically, the most popular people in our class[nl]are Kirisaki, Onodera, Marika, and Seishiro.
RAK/RAK0063270
(Ohh, that's about who I expected.)
SYU/SYU0012670
Our class really is so blessed.[nl]To think we're home to some of the most[nl]beautiful girls in the school!
SYU/SYU0012680
Incidentially, to everyone's surprise, among those who[nl]received votes are Marika's attendant, Honda, and our[nl]homeroom teacher, Ms. Kyoko.
SYU/SYU0012690
Ruri also has a fair few supporters. Seems like she's[nl]got quite a lot of fans out there.
RAK/RAK0063280
If she finds out, you're seriously toast....
SYU/SYU0012700
So, who are you voting for?
RAK/RAK0063290
Huh? Me!?
SYU/SYU0012710
I've prepared you a ballot and everything, so please[nl]write in your vote! You may vote anonymously if you wish.
SYU/SYU0012720
Events like this are a lot more fun[nl]the more people participate, so please vote.
RAK/RAK0063300
Hmmmm.... Let's see.[nl]I'll go with....
Chitoge
Onodera
Tsugumi
Tachibana
RAK/RAK0063310
(Well, she would be pretty beautiful if she'd keep[nl] her mouth shut. Besides, we're officially[nl] a couple, so I'll vote for her....)
RAK/RAK0063320
Alright. I'm done, Shuu.
@ＢＧＭ停止
CTG/CTG0014940
Hey, what are you doing?
RAK/RAK0063330G
Aah!?
RAK/RAK0063340
C-Chitoge....!?
CTG/CTG0014950
What's that? That paper?[nl]Is that something written on it?
RAK/RAK0063350
No, this is, umm....
SYU/SYU0012740
All units, fall back, fall back![nl]We're retreating!
MSA/MSA0000240G
AAAAAAAAAHHHH!
RAK/RAK0063360
Aaah, wait up![nl]I'm retreating too!
CTG/CTG0014960
Oh...wait![nl]Hang on a second!
CTG/CTG0014970
Jeez....what the hell was with them!?
CTG/CTG0014980
And Raku even dropped that paper he was holding....[nl]What's it say....?
CTG/CTG0014990
"Most Beautiful Girl Contest"?[nl]Hahh, that's ridiculous.
CTG/CTG0015000
....Whaa!?[nl]T-That's my name on there!
@ザクシャ千棘・大
CTG/CTG0015010
Does he see me that way after all?
CTG/CTG0015020
No, no! That's not possible![nl]What the hell am I even saying!?
CTG/CTG0015030
Maybe it's just....[nl]He wrote this because we're supposed to be lovers?
CTG/CTG0015040
T-That must be it, right?
RAK/RAK0063370
(No contest, Onodera gets my vote![nl] Honestly, I'd rather not have anyone see this,[nl] but I can't just lie.)
KSK/KSK0017160
What are you guys doing?
RAK/RAK0063380
O-Onodera....!?
KSK/KSK0017170
What's on that paper? Are you all drawing?[nl]Sounds like fun! ♪
KSK/KSK0017180
Huh!? W-Why....!?
KSK/KSK0017190
Oh....Ichijo dropped his paper.[nl]Is it okay to look at it....?
KSK/KSK0017200
Let's see.... Huh!?[nl]"Most Beautiful Girl Contest"!?
KSK/KSK0017210
W-Whaaa!? Why is my name written on here!?
KSK/KSK0017220
D-Does that mean Ichijo put my name here!?[nl]B-But why....!?
.......
@ザクシャ小咲・大
KSK/KSK0017230
I'm happy, but it's also kind of embarrassing....[nl]Hehehehe....
RAK/RAK0063390
(I guess Tsugumi....[nl] She's probably pretty cute when she dresses like a girl.)
SSR/SSR0020020
What's this? Are you boys up to something?
RAK/RAK0063400
Tsugumi....!?
SSR/SSR0020030
Mgh.... What's that suspicious paper you've got?[nl]Lemme see that for a sec.
RAK/RAK0063350
No, the thing is, um....
SSR/SSR0020040
Ah, hey! Why are you all running away!?
SSR/SSR0020050
....Good grief, I don't understand this.
SSR/SSR0020060
Hm? Raku Ichijo dropped that paper he had.
SSR/SSR0020070
Hmmm.... "Most Beautiful Girl Contest"?[nl]Just another idiotic--
SSR/SSR0020080
Huh....?
@ザクシャ誠士郎・大
SSR/SSR0020090
T-This is my name!?[nl]W-W-W-W-Why'd he do that!?
SSR/SSR0020100
W-Wait wait, calm down![nl]This has to be some kind of prank!
SSR/SSR0020110
T-T-There's no way Raku Ichijo thinks I'm cute or anything![nl]There's no way that could be true!
SSR/SSR0020120
Besides, I don't even care what[nl]Raku Ichijo thinks about me....
SSR/SSR0020130
So even if he *does* think I'm cute,[nl]that doesn't matter to me at all....
SSR/SSR0020140
....Nghh.
SSR/SSR0020150
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
SSR/SSR0020160
Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]The next time I see him, I'll confront him about this.
SSR/SSR0020170
You'd better be ready, Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0063410
(Tachibana's definitely got her fair share of issues,[nl] but if the question is whether or not she's beautiful,[nl] I'd have to say she's pretty cute....)
RAK/RAK0063420
(Seems like a pretty good idea to pick Tachibana.)
MRK/MRK0011110
I've finally found you, Raku dearest! ★
RAK/RAK0063430
T-Tachibana....!?
MRK/MRK0011120
Oh? What's everyone gathered up here for?[nl]And what's this little piece of paper for....?
MRK/MRK0011130
What? Where's everyone going?
MRK/MRK0011140
Oh? Raku dearest dropped his paper.[nl]I must bring it back to him posthaste.
MRK/MRK0011150
....But before I do that,[nl]let's see what's on it.
MRK/MRK0011160
Let's see. "Most Beautiful Girl Contest"?[nl]Well, this is most interesting.
MRK/MRK0011170
Oh? Isn't this....my name?
@ザクシャ万里花・大
MRK/MRK0011180
D-Don't tell me! Raku dearest, you think I'm[nl]the most beautiful girl....!?
MRK/MRK0011190
N-No way....[nl]Then why?
MRK/MRK0011200
Why aren't you more proactive with me!?
MRK/MRK0011210
Raku dearesssst! Where are youuu!?
MRK/MRK0011220
Please tell me exactly what it is[nl]about me that you find cuuuuute!
