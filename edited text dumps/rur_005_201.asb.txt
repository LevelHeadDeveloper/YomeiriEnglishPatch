Hey, Ichijo. Where's Maiko's hideout?[nl]Where's the black market?
RAK/RAK0031210
I'm telling you, I don't know![nl]I'm not an accomplice!
RUR/RUR0004940
I see you're still trying to keep me in the dark.
RUR/RUR0004950
No matter. I'll just ask your body directly.
RAK/RAK0031220
Eh....!?
RUR/RUR0004955
Mmmph!

RUR/RUR0004960
Since you're mounted like this,[nl]you can't escape, can you?
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0031230
GAAAAAAAAAHH!?
RUR/RUR0004970
Come on. If you don't spit it out,[nl]I'll tighten it even more.
RAK/RAK0031240
H-Hang on, Miyamoto![nl]I really don't know anything!
RUR/RUR0004985
You're surprisingly stubborn....here.
RAK/RAK0031250
GWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!?[nl]I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!
RUR/RUR0004990
You're still not gonna tell me?
RAK/RAK0031260
I can't tell you![nl]I can't tell you because I don't know anything!
......
RUR/RUR0005000
You really don't know anything?
RAK/RAK0031270
R_Really and truly![nl]I'm innocent! So hurry up and let me goooooo!
@expose
RUR/RUR0005010
Hmmmm.....
RUR/RUR0005020
No signs of lying....[nl]Alright, I'll let you go.
RAK/RAK0031280
Owwww.....[nl]I really thought I was gonna die there....
@rur_005_201_02
RUR/RUR0005030
Sorry. I really thought you were Maiko's pawn.
RAK/RAK0031290
You finally trust me....
RUR/RUR0005040
....Well, for now.

RUR/RUR0005050
Anyway, we can't let the distribution[nl]of these shameless booklets slide.
RUR/RUR0005060
Today'll be the day I smash that Four-Eyes' four eyes[nl]to pieces, so we should find him as soon as possible.
RAK/RAK0031300
H-Hey, go easy on him....[nl]He probably didn't mean any harm.
RUR/RUR0005070
Why are you talking like this is[nl]someone else's problem, Ichijo?[nl]We'll be searching for Maiko together.
RAK/RAK0031310
Me too, huh....[nl]Well, I guess I kind of saw that coming.
RUR/RUR0005080
You're somewhat responsible for this.[nl]You won't refuse.
RAK/RAK0031320
Right, right, got it.
RAK/RAK0031330
But even if I say I'll help you....[nl]He's been disappearing off to who-knows-where[nl]after school, so I have no idea where he is.
RUR/RUR0005090
Most likely, he's holding his black market[nl]somewhere inside the school.[nl]Maybe even at this very moment.
RAK/RAK0031340
If he's in the school, we can probably find him[nl]pretty easily. Alright, let's get goi--

MSA/MSA0000050
....Wait! I can't let you do that, Raku!
RAK/RAK0031350
Whaa!?
MSB/MSB0000020
If I'm hearing this correctly,[nl]you guys are planning to bring down Maiko's black market!
MSC/MSC0000010
Ichijo. We cannot allow you to do that.
RAK/RAK0031360
Y-You guys![nl]What's the matter with all of you!?
MSB/MSB0000030
We won't let a harem guy like you[nl]mess with us ordinary guys and[nl]our black market paradise!
MSA/MSA0000060
Shuu's black market and the photos he provides[nl]are an oasis for our hearts....[nl]We can't let you take that away from us!
RUR/RUR0005100
I see....[nl]Maiko and his clients are very close.
RAK/RAK0031370
Hey, hey, you guys! Calm down!
RAK/RAK0031380
It doesn't matter if a black market or two goes under.[nl]It's pretty sketchy anyways....
MSA/MSA0000070
You don't get it![nl]Raku, you don't get it at all!
MSB/MSB0000040
It's a secret photo,[nl]that's what's so hot about it!
MSC/MSC0000020
E-Exactly! We want to see[nl]"Exquisitely Embarrassing Shots" of Kirisaki[nl]and Onodera, too!
RUR/RUR0005110
....Unbelievable. Are all boys like this?
MSA/MSA0000080
Alright, all of you![nl]Restrain Raku! Protect our utopia!
MSB/MSB0000050
A class struggle![nl]Popular vs. Unpopular!
MSC/MSC0000030
That's right![nl]Divine punishment for having girlfriends!
RAK/RAK0031390
Woaaaah! What's wrong with you guys!?
@expose
RUR/RUR0005120
We don't have time to deal with them.[nl]Let's run away, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0031400
(Oh man, what a pain in the ass!)
RAK/RAK0031410
(We've got to find Shuu[nl] before these guys catch me!)
