I have to keep these feelings tucked away[nl]in the back of my mind until they disappear....
Those feelings....
Will you tell me if[nl]I buy you dinner?
Do you want them to disappear?

I'm not telling you if you talk to me like that![nl]What kind of moron are you!?
RAK/RAK0020030
Why am I even bothering with you....?[nl]You're just making me angrier and angrier.
RAK/RAK0020040
I'll never tell you anything again....

There's a part of me that wants them to disappear[nl]and a part of me that wants to keep them.
