...so, you're this shrine's resident goddess?
OTM/OTM0003210
Mhm. I am the "Fox Incarnation", or[nl]the so-called "Inari-sama".
OTM/OTM0003220
...Well, I'm still in training, so I'm technically[nl]not a goddess yet. I'm more fox than goddess....
OTM/OTM0003230
But someday I shall become a full goddess![nl]That is my goal here!
RAK/RAK0034590
Hmm... I'm not sure I understand, but good luck.[nl]But can you head to elementary school or something?[nl]If you don't, you'll regret it when you grow up....
@expose
OTM/OTM0003240
After I went to all the trouble to explain everything to thee,[nl]thou wouldst still refuse to believe me![nl]I am not in elementary school!
RAK/RAK0034600
Right, right... I have to go. If I'm late to meet[nl]Chitoge, she'll knock me into lower orbit. 
RAK/RAK0034610
See you around, Otama.[nl]If we meet again, I'll listen more carefully!
@ＢＧＭ停止
OTM/OTM0003250
Fuu... what a hard-headed young man.
OTM/OTM0003260
But, he seems at least decent....[nl]And that inari sushi he hath made...
OTM/OTM0003270
That flavor is.... unforgettable.

You're late, Raku![nl]What kind of boyfriend are you,[nl]keeping me waiting?!?
RAK/RAK0034620
Hey, hey, my bad, Chitoge.[nl]I had an errand to run and it took a bit longer[nl]than I expected.
RAK/RAK0034630
I mean, thanks for waiting for me.
@expose
CTG/CTG0010080
That's just because.....people would get suspicious[nl]if we didn't at least walk to school together, right?
CTG/CTG0010090
It's not as though I wanted to walk with[nl] you or anything like that!
RAK/RAK0034645
Understood.
RAK/RAK0034655
After all, our relationship is a total sham.

Owww! Why did you do that!?
CTG/CTG0010110
Quiet! Watch your mouth!
CTG/CTG0010120
I'm not really into you at all...
RAK/RAK0034670
Huh? What did you say?
CTG/CTG0010130
Nothing whatsoever!!
RAK/RAK0034680
Gwahh!?

SSR/SSR0010080
Good morning, mistress!
SSR/SSR0010090
Um....hello, Raku Ichijo.[nl]Why are you on the ground like that?
RAK/RAK0034690
Ohh.... Hi, Tsugumi.[nl]You'd have to ask Chitoge why I'm here.
CTG/CTG0010140
Hmph!
SSR/SSR0010100
It was probably your fault. You're no good.[nl]Bad to the bone.
SSR/SSR0010110
First of all, it's bad that you're dating the mistress.
RAK/RAK0034700
Complete denial....

RA・KU・DEAR・ESSSST★
RAK/RAK0034710
Whaa, Tachibana!?
MRK/MRK0008840
Good morning, Raku dearest![nl]You look so manly and interesting todaaaay!                        
RAK/RAK0034720
Hey, hey![nl]Stop jumping me like that!
MRK/MRK0008850
But I haven't seen you for a whole day![nl]Please, let me see your face up close.
RAK/RAK0034730
Too close! You're too clooose!
SSR/SSR0010120
Hey, what are you doing, Raku Ichijo?[nl]Push her off of you this instant!
CTG/CTG0010150
Yeah![nl]What kind of nerve do you have, pulling that[nl]kind of thing right near your girlfriend?
RAK/RAK0034740
How is this my fault!?
MRK/MRK0008860
Let's find someplace away from[nl]these barbarians, Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0008870
After all, we've been engaged for ten years...[nl]Nothing can get in the way of our love.
SSR/SSR0010130
...tch... I don't care if it's an old promise or what![nl]It doesn't matter now!
RAK/RAK0034750
You guys![nl]It's too early in the morning to be fighting!
SSR/SSR0010140
You shut your trap!
SSR/SSR0010150
I mean, why am I getting so damn worked up[nl]over a guy like you!?!?
RAK/RAK0034760
I have no clue....
KSK/KSK0008590
Good morning.[nl]How is everyone doing?
RAK/RAK0034770
(Huh....that voice...!)
@expose
KSK/KSK0008600
Good morning, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0034780
(O-Onoderaa--!!)
KSK/KSK0008610
....What happened to your nose?[nl]It's bleeding!?
RAK/RAK0034790
Um....there was a bit of a dispute.
KSK/KSK0008620
That's awful! Hold on a sec...
KSK/KSK0008630
Here, I have a bandage.[nl]Let me put it on.
RAK/RAK0034800
(Whoa![nl]O-Onodera's so close...!)
RAK/RAK0034810
(Aaa, I'm so glad I got hurt....[nl]Her mere presence is healing me...! Really!)

SYU/SYU0005940
Gooood morning, Raku![nl]What, you've got the most beautiful girls in the class all[nl]walking to school with you this morning? I'm so jealous!
SYU/SYU0005950
Well, at least I'm walking with Ruri.[nl]I have no regrets. ♪
RUR/RUR0007550
You ran into me halfway and started following me.
SYU/SYU0005960
Ouch, you're as terrible as ever, Ruri.
RUR/RUR0007560
Sorry to interrupt your talking, but if you don't hurry up,[nl]you'll be late.
SSR/SSR0010160
Hmm... she's right.[nl]Mistress, let's move!
MRK/MRK0008880
Raku dearest, would you like to walk slowly with me?
SSR/SSR0010170
Weren't you listening? We're going to be late!
CTG/CTG0010160
Not to repeat what she said,[nl]but you're practically stuck to Raku![nl]You'd better move right now!
MRK/MRK0008890
Okay, Kirisaki--! I'll concede the morning commute,[nl]for I shall sit next to Raku dearest in class!
SYU/SYU0005970
Haha, as usual, buddy, you've got flowers in both hands.
RUR/RUR0007570
Totally... I wonder why Kosaki doesn't just jump in.
KSK/KSK0008640
R-Ruri!
SSR/SSR0010180
Hurry up, Raku Ichijo! Run if you have to![nl]Are you trying to make the mistress late?
RAK/RAK0034820
Got it.
RAK/RAK0034830
(Fwah....[nl]Looks like it's gonna be another crazy day.)
OTM/OTM0003280
Mwehehe... so his name is "Raku Ichijo", huh?
OTM/OTM0003290

Today's been packed since morning.[nl]I think I'll go straight to bed when I get home.
RAK/RAK0034860

(Claude Ringheart, the Beehive's top agent![nl] He's the one who most suspects that me and[nl] Chitoge aren't really dating!)
RAK/RAK0034890
Why the hell are you inside the school[nl]to begin with!?
CLD/CLD0001720
I hath been looking for thee.[nl]I have a small question for thee.
RAK/RAK0034900
(Tch, it's about my relationship with Chitoge, isn't it?[nl] To be caught here and asked strange questions,[nl] it can't be good...)
CLD/CLD0001730
Now, come over here.[nl]Quietly.
RAK/RAK0034910
Screw that![nl]See ya!
CLD/CLD0001740
Wh-what?[nl]Wait! Cometh back!
