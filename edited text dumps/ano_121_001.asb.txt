Heey, Raku! Over here, over here!
RAK/RAK0064390
Don't tell me I'm the last one here.
KSK/KSK0017430
Yes. Ruri and Tachibana left to get some[nl]gifts at the flea market.
@expose
SSR/SSR0020460
I hope you brought a gift for this as well.
RAK/RAK0064400
Oh no! Come to think of it,[nl]I couldn't find anything good!
CTG/CTG0015380
Jeez. I knew this would happen.
SYU/SYU0012810
Why don't you also head to the flea market?[nl]You might find a real bargain.
RAK/RAK0064410
Okay. I'll hurry!
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0064420
Hmmm...[nl]Accessories, some toys and games, even books.
RAK/RAK0064430
...I guess I'll play it safe with an accessory.[nl]If a girl gets it, great. If a dude gets it, he can[nl]just regift it to someone else.
RAK/RAK0064440
Let's see.... What sort of accessories look good....?
Ribbon
Necklace
Hair Clip
Earrings
RAK/RAK0064450
...A ribbon, huh?[nl]I bet it would look great on Chitoge.
RAK/RAK0064460
I'm not saying she's likely to get it, but....
RAK/RAK0064470
Okay... I'll get this one!
RAK/RAK0064480
I like this necklace. It has a nice air of maturity.[nl]If Onodera wore something like this,[nl]I'll bet it would look great....
RAK/RAK0064490
Not that it's certain Onodera will[nl]get this, though....
RAK/RAK0064500
Come to think of it, Tachibana always has a hair clip[nl]just like this one. I bet it would look great on her.
RAK/RAK0064510
Well, that doesn't mean Tachibana will get it, but....
RAK/RAK0064520
For now, I'll buy this one.
RAK/RAK0064530
Oh, these earrings are pretty stylish.[nl]I bet Tsugumi would look great wearing them.
RAK/RAK0064540
I'm not saying she'll necessarily end up with them, but....
RAK/RAK0064550
I'll just go for this one.
RYU/RYU0001530
Alright, ev'ryone, thanks for waitin'![nl]It's time to see who got which gifts!
RYU/RYU0001540
Everyone, please open the piece of paper you were given!
RAK/RAK0064560
(Hey, I wonder who got my gift?)
CTG/CTG0015390
Wow, cute ribbon!
RAK/RAK0064570
Whoa, Chitoge, you actually got it!
CTG/CTG0015400
Huh? Is this the gift you bought, Raku!?
RAK/RAK0064580
I saw that ribbon and thought it would[nl]look great on you, so I got it.[nl]I didn't think you'd really end up with it.
@ザクシャ千棘・大
CTG/CTG0015410
Haha, what the heck?[nl]It's not like it was certain I'd get it.
CTG/CTG0015420
But, I might be happy anyway.[nl]What you just said earned you a lot of boyfriend points.
CTG/CTG0015430
...I'll wear it on one of our dates sometime,[nl]so be on the lookout for that, okay?
KSK/KSK0017450
Wowww, what a beautiful necklace!
RAK/RAK0064590
Whoa!? It seriously ended up with you, Onodera!?
KSK/KSK0017460
Huh? Is this present from you, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0064600
Yeah, that's right....
@ザクシャ小咲・大
KSK/KSK0017470
Ooh.... It's so stylish and mature.[nl]I love it.
KSK/KSK0017480
But I wonder if it would suit me with how childish I am?
RAK/RAK0064610
Don't say that![nl]It suits you better that anyone else here!
KSK/KSK0017490
I-Is that so?
KSK/KSK0017500
....If you say so, I guess I'll believe you.
KSK/KSK0017510
I'll wear this the next time I go visit you.[nl]Thank you, Ichijo,
MRK/MRK0011470
Oh my, it's a hair clip.
RAK/RAK0064620
Oh, wow! I can't believe you actually got it.
MRK/MRK0011480
Huuhh!?[nl]So, this is the present that you picked out, Raku dearest?
RAK/RAK0064630
It's the one that caught my eye.[nl]I figured it would suit you if you got it, right?
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0011490
T-This means that Raku dearest[nl]has given me a gift...
RAK/RAK0064640
Well, I guess.
MRK/MRK0011500
A gift, given to me by Raku dearest out of love...
RAK/RAK0064650
Where did that come from!?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0011510
Raku dearest! I'm so happy I could die![nl]I'm so lucky, I'm so happy, I'm so gosh darn HAAPPPYYYY!
RAK/RAK0064660
Oh, okay... So you like it.[nl]I'm glad.
MRK/MRK0011520
I'll put this hair clip in a glass case, and then I'll buy an[nl]anti-theft infrared sensor so no one can steal it...
RAK/RAK0064670
N-No, you can just use it normally.[nl]It wasn't that expensive.
MRK/MRK0011530
But it's something you gave me, Raku dearest.[nl]It's worth more to me than any expensive gift.
SSR/SSR0020470
Hmm.... Earrings?[nl]I don't think I've ever worn something like these...
RAK/RAK0064680
Tsugumi, you actually got them!
SSR/SSR0020480
What!?[nl]....So, this is the present you picked out?
RAK/RAK0064690
That's right.[nl]I thought they would look cool if you wore them,[nl]but I didn't think you'd actually get them!
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0020490
S-Stop trying to flatter me![nl]There's no way I'd look good in earrings.
RAK/RAK0064700
That's not true.[nl]Put it on and go find the guy you like.[nl]He'll probably compliment you.
SSR/SSR0020500
T-There's no one I like!
RAK/RAK0064710
W-Why are you yelling?[nl]You took me by surprise....
SSR/SSR0020510
Good grief....
SSR/SSR0020520
....Next time, I'll put these earrings on, [nl]so you can see how I look.
RAK/RAK0064720
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0020530
It was your idea.[nl]I want to see if you really think they suit me.
RAK/RAK0064730
....Do you actually like them more than you thought?
SSR/SSR0020540
S-Shut up![nl]Who could be happy with a present from you!?!?
SSR/SSR0020550
I'm not happy with these![nl]Not one bit!
RAK/RAK0064740
Right, right... I get it.[nl]You're angry, probably embarrassed...[nl]You're probably having a tough time.
RAK/RAK0064750
(I'm glad she liked the present.)
