Shuu, let's go home together.
SYU/SYU0011730
Wanna stop and hang out somewhere on the way?
RAK/RAK0061970
Yeah, sounds good.

......
SYU/SYU0011740
Not much to do, is there.
RAK/RAK0061980
We've been doing stuff together since kindergarten, after all.[nl]We've done all the usual stuff already, and it's not like we[nl]can hit up a game center or karaoke with just us two....
RAK/RAK0061990
On the other hand, if we just grab a bite to eat[nl]and talk as usual, that seems like a waste....[nl]Is there anything interesting going on right now....?
SYU/SYU0011750
Hmmmm....
@expose
@ＢＧＭ再生
SYU/SYU0011760
Alright, let's hit on some girls!
RAK/RAK0062000
Huh!?
SYU/SYU0011770
The only thing we haven't done together is pick up girls,[nl]right? Let's get excited about some new encounters[nl]and add a little spice to our otherwise drab lives!
RAK/RAK0062010
I wouldn't say my life is exactly drab....
SYU/SYU0011780
You've got a cute girlfriend, right? It also looks[nl]like you're in love with another girl, and of course[nl]your fiancee is also after you.
@expose2
SYU/SYU0011790
Your life may be very fulfilling, I'm sure,[nl]but I don't have any of those kinds of people in mine!
SYU/SYU0011800
Do you know how it feels to be alone?[nl]Can you find it in your heart to save me!?
RAK/RAK0062020
Ghh.... This is a really weird time to get sulky.
SYU/SYU0011810
Alright then, let's give it a shot![nl]If anything goes wrong, I'll take responsibility,[nl]so don't worry. ♪
SYU/SYU0011820
Look, there's some girls over there, so pick one[nl]and chat her up! All you really need is a good pickup line!
RAK/RAK0062030
Pickup line....[nl]I don't even know what to say to a girl I've never met before.
SYU/SYU0011830
All you gotta do is heap on the compliments![nl]Now go on, get moving!
RAK/RAK0062040
Damn, you're pushy.[nl]You're taking responsibility for this, right?
SYU/SYU0011840
Absolutely! Now, which girl are you gonna talk to?
RAK/RAK0062050
(Guess it can't be helped.[nl] Let's see....)
The blonde one
The tall one
Think it over some more.
RAK/RAK0062060
H-Hey, there! You, the cutie with the beautiful hair![nl]Wanna go get some tea or something with us?
CTG/CTG0014580
....Huh? What are you doing?
RAK/RAK0062070
Gaah!? C-Chitoge!?
CTG/CTG0014590
Was that supposed to be a pickup line? Pfft....[nl]Aren't we getting a bit cocky for a bean sprout?
RAK/RAK0062080
Shaddup! It's kinda complicated....[nl]But there's also a simple explanation for why I'm doing this!
CTG/CTG0014600
Hmmm.....I don't care.
CTG/CTG0014610
Either way, you're supposed to be dating someone,[nl]so you shouldn't be hitting on other girls, right?
CTG/CTG0014620
On top of all that, you didn't even recognize me,[nl]the *person who is supposed to be your girlfriend*, and[nl]you tried to pick me up....
RAK/RAK0062090
Wait! I can explain!
CTG/CTG0014630
End of discussion![nl]GRIT YOUR TEEEEETH!
RAK/RAK0062100
Eeeeek!
CTG/CTG0014640
Oh! Stop running away!
RAK/RAK0062110
(I-I've got no choice but to run!)
RAK/RAK0062120
H-Hey, there! You, the tall, beautiful lady![nl]How'd you like to join us for a fun afternoo--
SSR/SSR0019720
Hahh.... Not another one of these guys.
RAK/RAK0062130
Gaah!? T-Tsugumi!?
SSR/SSR0019730
Whaa!? R-Raku Ichijo!?
SSR/SSR0019740
W-W-What do you think you're doing!?[nl]You said I was beautiful or something....
RAK/RAK0062140
No, no, it's kinda complicated....[nl]But there's also a simple explanation for why I'm doing this!
SSR/SSR0019770
!![nl]Come to think of it, he did say his type was "short black hair,[nl]aggressive, physically fit, but also kind of a scaredy-cat"....
RAK/RAK0062150
Huh? What are you muttering about?
SSR/SSR0019780
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH![nl]I WILL NEVER BECOME YOUR MISTRESS, NO MATTER WHAT!
RAK/RAK0062160
What are you talking about!?
SSR/SSR0019750
No, come to think of it, what *are* you doing!?[nl]You have the Mistress already, and yet here you are[nl]trying to pick up other girls!?
RAK/RAK0076240
Gaah!?
SSR/SSR0009580
Wait, Raku Ichijo!
The quiet-looking one
The tidy one with colored hair
I don't want to do this.
RAK/RAK0062180
H-Hey, there! You, the cute young lady.[nl]Care to have a chat with us for a while?
KSK/KSK0016780
Huh....? C-Cute?
RAK/RAK0062190
O-O-O-O-O-Onoderaaaaa!?
KSK/KSK0016790
I-Ichijo!?
RAK/RAK0062200
Y-You've got it all wrong![nl]Basically, Shuu forced me to come out and hit on girls....![nl]Ummm, uhh....
@expose
KSK/KSK0016800
C-C-Calm down, Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0062210
Sorry! I got pretty worked up there....
RAK/RAK0062220
(This is the worst! Of all the people I could have picked,[nl] I decided to hit on Onodera.... I'm such an idiot![nl] Die, me!)
KSK/KSK0016810
I-I guess you're a healthy, red-blooded male, Ichijo.[nl]Even you try to pick up girls sometimes....
RAK/RAK0062230
No, no. This is because Shuu forced me[nl]to pick someone up....
KSK/KSK0016820
That's right. It is important to spend quality time[nl]with your friends. I-I'm sorry for making you[nl]talk to me....
RAK/RAK0062240
(Aaagh! She's getting further away!)
KSK/KSK0016830
I-I'll be going now, okay?[nl]My sister's waiting for me over there....
KSK/KSK0016840
....See you later!
RAK/RAK0062250
A-Aaaaagh....!
RAK/RAK0062260
H-Hey, there! You, the cutie with the hair ornament.[nl]Do you have a moment to spare?
MRK/MRK0010820
Oh, my, Raku dearest!?
RAK/RAK0062270
Gah, Tachibana!? Is was you!?
MRK/MRK0010830
Of course it's meeeee!
MRK/MRK0010840
I must say I'm surprised that you're the type to[nl]pick up girls, but I'm even more surprise that you'd[nl]try to pick up me!
MRK/MRK0010850
I have however many moments to spare that you need![nl]Because from this moment on, we're gonna be a married couple!
RAK/RAK0062280
Blrrrrf![nl]M-Married couple!?
MRK/MRK0010860
Now then, let us be off to town hall on the high note[nl]of you picking me up! We must sign the marriage registration and go straight[nl]to the wedding hall before you change your mind!
RAK/RAK0062290
Calm down calm down calm down![nl]There's a simple explanation for this, but it's also complicated....!
@expose2
MRK/MRK0010870
No matter the circumstances, the fact is you picked me up.[nl]This must be reported to my father!
RAK/RAK0062300
STOOOOPPPP IIIITTTT!
RAK/RAK0062310
AAAAAAAAAAAGGH!
MRK/MRK0010880
Aah, Raku dearest![nl]Don't run away!
RAK/RAK0062410
Uhh, no, I don't think I wanna do this after all.
SYU/SYU0011880
Awww, why not!?
RAK/RAK0062420
Just listen to me! I don't wanna do this,[nl]so just let me be this time!
SYU/SYU0011890
Huh!? Y-Yeah....[nl]W-Well, if you really insist....
RAK/RAK0062430
(I can't put my finger on why....[nl] But I feel like no matter which of them I chose,[nl] there would have been an absolute minefield in store for me....)
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0062320
(Hahh. What a mess I've gotten myself into.[nl] I shouldn't have tried picking her up....)
RAK/RAK0062330
Hey, Shuu. I'm sorry, but today I can't....
RAK/RAK0062340
Huh? Shuu? Where'd he go?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RUR/RUR0012130
Maiko's right here. Under my feet.
SYU/SYU0011850
Glbctkh....I'd never have....guessed....[nl]that the person I was trying to pick up was....Ruri....[nl]H-How careless of me....
SYU/SYU0011860
Gaackh....
RAK/RAK0062350
Shuu!? Speak to me, man!
CTG/CTG0014650
So, Darling. You're more worried for him than for yourself.
RAK/RAK0062360
Eek...!
CTG/CTG0014660
You massively stupid bean sprout, going out[nl]and hitting on girls....
SSR/SSR0019800
Are you really more worried about him[nl]than you are for yourself, Raku Ichijo?
SSR/SSR0019810
I wouldn't have thought you'd have the gall to[nl]try to pick me up.... That was just plain reckless[nl]on your part.
SSR/SSR0019820
For that, you're getting sanctions more terrifying than death!
RUR/RUR0012140
Can you really afford to be more worried[nl]about him than yourself, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0062370
Huh?
RUR/RUR0012150
I heard all about it. You were picking up girls[nl]right along with this scum, weren't you?
RAK/RAK0062380
(Aaaaaagh! Shuu, you bastard!)
RUR/RUR0012160
Sweet dreams, Ichijo.

So this....this is how it always goes....
RAK/RAK0062400
This is how it always goes....[nl]when I go along with your plans....
