Like an after school date?
CTG/CTG0024490
Alright, sounds good.
@expose
CTG/CTG0024500
Oh, but we're still[nl]having lunch together, right?
@フェードアウト
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0024510
Sorry I'm late.
CTG/CTG0024520
Tsugumi caught me on my way out.[nl]It took a bit to get away from her.
CTG/CTG0024530
So, where are we going today?
@ctg_401_051_1
The arcade
The park
@ctg_401_052
CTG/CTG0024540
I'd rather go to the arcade though....
CTG/CTG0024550
Alright, it's settled.[nl]We're off to the arcade today!
CTG/CTG0024560
Come on, quit spacing out and let's go!
@ctg_401_053
CTG/CTG0024570
What a coincidence.[nl]I was thinking the exact same thing.
CTG/CTG0024580
Okay, let's get going!
@ctg_401_054
@背景変更
@ctg_401_055
CTG/CTG0024600
Yes, that one!
@ctg_401_056
CTG/CTG0024610
No, no! The next one over,[nl]the stuffed gorilla!
@ctg_401_057
@expose2
CTG/CTG0024620
Hmmmmm....[nl]I really like that one's facial expression.
CTG/CTG0024630
Hey, hey, try to get[nl]that one for me, please.
CTG/CTG0024640
Sorry, but I'm not very good at[nl]the crane games myself.
Leave it to me
Let's do it together
@ctg_401_058
CTG/CTG0024650
If you don't get it,[nl]you're not getting out of this.
CTG/CTG0024660
....Just kidding. ★
.........
CTG/CTG0024670
I'd never have thought it would[nl]be impossible to get that prize....
CTG/CTG0024680
Oh well, some days are like that.[nl]Let's try again next time!
@マジコイ終了処理
@ctg_401_059
CTG/CTG0024690
Huh?[nl]You're not too confident either?
CTG/CTG0024700
Can't be helped, then.[nl]Let's do it together.
CTG/CTG0024710
Alriiiiight![nl]We won, we won!
CTG/CTG0024720
Look at those big eyes and tiny nose![nl]It's so CUTE!
CTG/CTG0024730
Alright, let's go get some photo stickers[nl]to commemorate our victory here!
@ctg_401_060
CTG/CTG0024740
Time sure flies when we're[nl]having fun like this.
CTG/CTG0024750
Let's head back soon. If I'm out too long,[nl]Claude and the others will worry.
@ctg_401_061
CTG/CTG0024760
Hm? What is it?
I'll walk you home
Nothing
@ctg_401_062
CTG/CTG0024770
Ahaaa. So you don't want to be[nl]away from me, do you?
CTG/CTG0024780
Huh? That was actually it!?
CTG/CTG0024790
I-I don't....[nl]I mean, I feel the same way....
.........
CTG/CTG0024800
Your hand.
CTG/CTG0024810
C'mon, gimme your hand.
CTG/CTG0024820
....Your hand is so warm.
CTG/CTG0024830
Yep.[nl]Let's go home hand in hand, like this.
@ctg_401_063
CTG/CTG0024840
You should invite me out again sometime.
CTG/CTG0024850
I want to hang out even more[nl]outside of our scheduled dates....
CTG/CTG0024860
Well then, shall we head home?
@ctg_401_064
CTG/CTG0024870
There's so many games, I can't[nl]decide on one to play....
CTG/CTG0024880
I'll let you pick.
Crane game
Trivia game
@ctg_401_065
CTG/CTG0024890
Ehh, okay.
CTG/CTG0024900
....Hm?
@ctg_401_066
CTG/CTG0024910
Hoho. You want to meet once again[nl]on the battlefield of knowledge?
CTG/CTG0024920
And you're challenging me despite the[nl]obvious gap between our academic prowesses, no less.
CTG/CTG0024930
Well, I'll give you a chance.
CTG/CTG0024940
I know. Since we're at it,[nl]wanna bet something on this, too?
A bottle of juice
One request
@ctg_401_067
CTG/CTG0024950
Cheap!
CTG/CTG0024960
Not so confident after all?[nl]....Well, okay.
CTG/CTG0024970
I-I lost....
CTG/CTG0024980
But doesn't it seem unfair that so many[nl]questions were about household chores!?
CTG/CTG0024990
Wait, you CHEATED, didn't you!?[nl]I'm sure you did!
Sore loser much?
Get me some juice
@ctg_401_068
@expose2
CTG/CTG0025000
Ghhhhhh!
@ctg_401_069
CTG/CTG0025010
So annoying!
@ctg_401_070
CTG/CTG0025020
Once you finish your juice,[nl]we'll play another round! Okay!?
@ctg_401_071
CTG/CTG0025030
....The winner makes a request of the loser?[nl]You're serious?
CTG/CTG0025040
Alright, I can take you!
CTG/CTG0025050
Hohoho! Victoryyy!
CTG/CTG0025060
You can't outsmart me in a quiz!
CTG/CTG0025070
Let's seeeee.[nl]What should I have you do?
Go easy....
I'll remember this
@ctg_401_072
CTG/CTG0025080
Don't worry, I'm not a monster.
@ctg_401_073
CTG/CTG0025090
You know what you should really remember?[nl]Your lack of ability.
@ctg_401_074
CTG/CTG0025100
Mmmm, delicious!
CTG/CTG0025110
Why is it that crepes[nl]smell so good, anyway?
You sure about this?
Vanilla extract
@ctg_401_075
CTG/CTG0025120
Yeah.[nl]I was just getting hungry.
CTG/CTG0025130
And if I had you do something unreasonable,[nl]it would have been too much trouble for you.
@ctg_401_076
CTG/CTG0025140
I know that much.[nl]I've just never used it myself.
CTG/CTG0025150
But from the name I can tell it's a very[nl]sweet and delicious seasoning!
@ctg_401_077
CTG/CTG0025160
The park?
CTG/CTG0025170
That's fine, but are you free[nl]to do that right now?
CTG/CTG0025180
Walking like this, it's really apparent[nl]that winter is coming soon.
@ctg_401_077_1
Leisurely stroll
There's a food stall!
@ctg_401_078
CTG/CTG0025190
The air's getting chilly,[nl]and pretty soon leaves will start falling.
CTG/CTG0025200
It's nice to take a peaceful walk[nl]like this once in a while.
Life's stressful
Peace is the best
@ctg_401_079
CTG/CTG0025210
Yup.
CTG/CTG0025220
Between Tsugumi, Marika, and Claude, right?[nl]Not to mention Maiko's constant shenanigans.
@ctg_401_080
CTG/CTG0025230
Yup. That hits close to home,[nl]especially with everything that happens to us....
CTG/CTG0025240
But even without all that,[nl]everything's so stressful....
@ctg_401_081
CTG/CTG0025250
Not that it isn't fun,[nl]but I'd just like to settle down a bit.
Look who's talking
For real though....
@ctg_401_082
CTG/CTG0025260
What? Are you saying it's my fault[nl]nothing's settling down?
..........
CTG/CTG0025270
Sorry. You might be right....
@ctg_401_083
CTG/CTG0025280
That's an awfully emotional response.[nl]Just how tired *are* you?
CTG/CTG0025290
Hey. By any chance.....
CTG/CTG0025300
From your perspective,[nl]do I seem, like, unstable?
@ctg_401_084
CTG/CTG0025310
I should maybe try to be more grown-up, huh?
You're OK as you are
You should try
@ctg_401_085
CTG/CTG0025320
Really....?
CTG/CTG0025330
....If you say so,[nl]then okay. I trust you.
@ctg_401_086
CTG/CTG0025340
That sounded a bit condescending.
CTG/CTG0025350
But you're right....[nl]Maybe I'll try harder....
@ctg_401_087
CTG/CTG0025360
Looks like it's an ice cream stand.[nl]Let's go!
CTG/CTG0025370
Mmmm, delicious![nl]Mint chocolate chip is the best!
CTG/CTG0025380
What kind did you get?
Vanilla
Passionfruit
@ctg_401_088
CTG/CTG0025390
Wow, that's plain....
CTG/CTG0025400
A really "vanilla", or safe, choice there.[nl]It really shows your personality.
CTG/CTG0025410
So, is vanilla any good?
Wanna try some?
It's delish!
@ctg_401_089
CTG/CTG0025420
Aren't you feeling reckless today.
CTG/CTG0025430
But like, is it any good?
@ctg_401_090
CTG/CTG0025440
Gimme a bite.
CTG/CTG0025450
Mmm....you're right.[nl]That *is* pretty good.
CTG/CTG0025460
But....here! Try some of mine![nl]The mint chocolate chip is miles better!
@ctg_401_091
CTG/CTG0025470
Hmmmm.
CTG/CTG0025480
Gotta say I think mint chocolate chip[nl]is the better flavor, though.
@ctg_401_954
@ctg_401_954_01
CTG/CTG0024590
Ah! That plushie is so cute!
A gorilla plush?
A girl plush?
