Hm....Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0057370
Yo, Tsugumi. What are you doing here?
SSR/SSR0016950
The Mistress left something at school,[nl]so I'm going to get it.
You're overprotective
You're nice to Chitoge
RAK/RAK0057380
If Chitoge forgot it, shouldn't she be the one to go get it?[nl]Don't you think you're being a little overprotective?
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
SSR/SSR0016960
Perhaps. The Mistress said the same thing.
SSR/SSR0016970
But this is what I like to do.[nl]You've got no business telling me what to do.
RAK/RAK0057390
Really? I can see the look of dissatisfaction[nl]on Chitoge's face, though.
RAK/RAK0057400
Really, you're endlessly kind to Chitoge.[nl]I'd appreciate it if you'd share at least[nl]1/100th of that kindness with me.
SSR/SSR0016980
I refuse to show you even 1/1000th.[nl]I have no obligation to be kind to you.
RAK/RAK0057410
Well, I knew you'd say that.
CLD/CLD0001960
Ohh?

RAK/RAK0057420
Geh! That sounds like....!
@ＢＧＭ再生
CLD/CLD0001970
Well, well, if it isn't the young master[nl]of the Ichijo family. And also....
CLD/CLD0001980
Seishiro. Why are you here?[nl]Also....alone with this guy.
@expose2
SSR/SSR0017000
M-Master Claude! Please don't misunderstand!
SSR/SSR0017010
I just so happen to be in the same place as this man,[nl]and we aren't on good terms or anything, okay!?
RAK/RAK0057430
You're talking too fast....
CLD/CLD0001990
I see....[nl]So that's what's going on.
CLD/CLD0002000
Seishiro. I raised you.[nl]So I have a rough idea what you're thinking.
SSR/SSR0017020
Huh? What could that be....?
CLD/CLD0002010
You're keeping an eye on him while[nl]the Mistress is away from him, right?
CLD/CLD0002020
If! If this lustful monkey is seeing another woman,[nl]you can shoot him on the spot!
CLD/CLD0002030
Well done as expected, Seishiro.[nl]It's common for two men who are friends to go everywhere[nl]with each other. You won't be suspicious at all.
RAK/RAK0057440
Hey, you know I can hear you....
CLD/CLD0002040
Well then, I'll be seeing you again, young master.[nl]I would ask that you and Seishiro have a wonderful[nl]man-to-man relationship as well.
CLD/CLD0002050
Well then....
SSR/SSR0017030
That man.... When will he realize that I'm a woman?
RAK/RAK0057450
From the looks of it, he might take a lifetime.[nl]Jeez, what a dense bastard.
SSR/SSR0017040
....You're hardly one to talk.
