@expose
SYU/SYU0013740
No, no, I'll go. I'll ask Ryuu where to find something.
SYU/SYU0013750
After all, I can't just interrupt a lover's talk, right?[nl]Bweheheheh.....
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0073830
....I just don't understand him at all.[nl]He knows we're not really dating, so why does he[nl]try to be so considerate?
@expose
CTG/CTG0021950
Yeah....especially when he says "lover's talk"....
......
CTG/CTG0021960
Hey, Raku.
RAK/RAK0073840
Hm?
CTG/CTG0021970
You're wearing your pendant again today.
RAK/RAK0073850
Yeah, of course. I wear it every day.
CTG/CTG0021980
You told me the lock was still broken, is that really true?
RAK/RAK0073860
Uh, yeah....[nl]I wasn't lying, okay?
CTG/CTG0021990
No, I didn't think you were lying....[nl]But we haven't actually *tried* to open it.
CTG/CTG0022000
I wonder if the....key....might somehow just go in[nl]if we tried putting it into the lock.
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0073870
Huh....?
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0022010
Hey, could you lend it to me for the night?[nl]I won't break anything this time.
RAK/RAK0073880
What are you talking about all of a sudden!?[nl]If we wanna try it, we can try it right here.
CTG/CTG0022020
I-I can't do that! I wanna do it somewhere no one can see!
CTG/CTG0022030
I know it's broken, but....[nl]But if there's even a small chance it's not....
@expose2
CTG/CTG0022040

RAK/RAK0073890
