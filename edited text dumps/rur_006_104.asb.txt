Another thing....yes.[nl]Glasses can also physically protect your eyes.
RUR/RUR0006640
Are you familiar with blue-light cutoff[nl]and UV protection?
RUR/RUR0006650
If we have a society where it's natural[nl]for everyone to wear glasses--
RUR/RUR0006660
Then we have a society that's[nl]easier on everyone's eyes.
Eye protection?
You don't need them 24/7
How about a full-face helmet?
Why not use eyedrops?

RUR/RUR0006670
We only need them when we're using the computer[nl]or going out, hm?
RUR/RUR0006680
....That is true, there's not much[nl]point in forcing them on all the time.
@rur_006_201
RUR/RUR0006690
But there's no harm in wearing them all the time.

What a lousy counterargument. Do you want every[nl]convenience store in the world to get robbed?
RUR/RUR0006710
I'd rather wear glasses a hundred times over[nl]than wear one of those all the time.
RUR/RUR0006720
Sure, but while eyedrops can help protect your eyes....
RUR/RUR0006730
An ounce of prevention is worth[nl]a pound of cure, right?
RUR/RUR0006740
Glasses would be several times easier.
RUR/RUR0006750
If you can't answer the question,[nl]does that mean you recognize their importance?
