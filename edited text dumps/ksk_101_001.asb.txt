SYU/SYU0007840

SYU/SYU0007850

SYU/SYU0007860
Raku, do you smell something sweet?
RAK/RAK0044960
Oh, it's this bag, right?[nl]These are strawberries.
RAK/RAK0044970
I had some yesterday and they were really good,[nl]so I figured I'd bring some to eat today during lunch break....
CTG/CTG0013480

RAK/RAK0045000

SSR/SSR0011970
Oh, you have strawberries, I see.[nl]They smell delicious.
RAK/RAK0045010
(T-This isn't good. I've only got enough of these[nl] for one person.... I brought them for Onodera to eat,[nl] but at this rate, there won't be any left....)
@ＢＧＭ停止
SYU/SYU0007870

MRK/MRK0010690
That's terrible, Maiko!
SYU/SYU0007880
Hahaha, you guys![nl]Raku here's trying to win over the prettiest girls[nl]by handing out strawberries!
MSA/MSA0000120

SYU/SYU0007890
Are we just gonna let him expand in popularity like this!?[nl]Hell no! That's no good! Everyone, help me[nl]keep this paper bag!
MSA/MSA0000130G

SSR/SSR0011990
Ghh, we can't just leave the civilians....
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0045030
Gaahh! L-Let go of me, you guys![nl]It's not fair that you outnumber me!
SYU/SYU0007900
Ha ha ha ha! You are helpless, Raku![nl]Now we boys shall have our fill of your strawberries!
RAK/RAK0045040
(I don't have that many strawberries![nl] No, that doesn't matter...)
RAK/RAK0045050
You guys....seriously get off of me!
@画面揺らし2
MSA/MSA0000140

@背景変更2
RAK/RAK0045080
Get back here! Get back heeeeeeeeere!
SYU/SYU0007930
Try and catch me~! Hahahahahahaha!
KSK/KSK0011130
Huh....? Was that Ichijo just now?
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0045090
Crap! Where's he gone!?
RAK/RAK0045100
I know this guy. He's probably back in the classroom,[nl]pretending to still be running. I'll go check back there....
RUR/RUR0010660
Wait.
RAK/RAK0045110
Huh, Miyamoto?
RUR/RUR0010670
Maiko's on the rooftop. Please hurry.
RAK/RAK0045120
Really!? Thanks for the info!
RUR/RUR0010680
Don't worry about it.
RUR/RUR0010690
You were planning on giving those strawberries to Kosaki,[nl]right? Hurry up and catch him before he eats them.
RAK/RAK0045130
Right! See ya!
RAK/RAK0045140
(Hmm? How did she know about the strawberries!?)
@スクリーン変更
SYU/SYU0007940
Hehhehhehheh.....
SYU/SYU0007950
After shaking off my compatriots, and overcoming[nl]numerous hardships, you have reached this point, Raku....
RAK/RAK0045150
Why are you pretending to be a Russian boss, you....[nl]Now give me back that bag!
SYU/SYU0007960
Hehehehehe..... You're too late![nl]It's already empty!
......
Punch Shuu
Listen to Shuu
RAK/RAK0045160
....Grit your teeth, Shuu.....
SYU/SYU0007970
Ahahahaha, you're serious.[nl]Did I go too far with my prank?
SYU/SYU0007980
Sorry, sorry. Here, your strawb--
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0007990
Gbcthk!
RAK/RAK0045170
RAK/RAK0045180
Oh, my strawberries![nl]I mean, I'm such an idiot!
RAK/RAK0045190
I thought you ate the strawberries![nl]Why did you go to so much trouble[nl]for a complicated prank!?
SYU/SYU0008000
N-Next time....try talking to me....first....
RAK/RAK0045200
Tell me what's going on.
SYU/SYU0008010
Hmm?
RAK/RAK0045210
You might be a jerk, but you're not the kind of guy[nl]who'd give me this much trouble for no reason.[nl]You must have a reason.
SYU/SYU0008020
....I see. Well, if you know that much,[nl]there's no point in dragging this on any longer.
SYU/SYU0008030
Here you go.
RAK/RAK0045220
Huh?
SYU/SYU0008040
There's still strawberries left.[nl]You were thinking of giving them to Onodera, weren't you?
SYU/SYU0008050
But before you could do that,[nl]the other girls were gonna eat them all.
SYU/SYU0008060
Because of your personality,[nl]there's no way you could just tell them "I want to[nl]give these to Onodera, so you guys can't have them."
RAK/RAK0045230
S-Seriously....[nl]So you intercepted?
RAK/RAK0045240
Shuu! Y-You're such a jerk!
SYU/SYU0008070
Yes, yes, you can thank me later. But you'd better go[nl]give those to Onodera before lunch break ends.[nl]She should be in the music room now.
RAK/RAK0045250
The music room?
KSK/KSK0011140
....Oh, Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0045260
Onodera! Why are you here?
KSK/KSK0011150
I'm not quite sure myself,[nl]but Ruri told me to come here....
RAK/RAK0045270
Miyamoto?
RAK/RAK0045280
I see....[nl]Shuu asked Miyamoto to ask you, didn't he.
KSK/KSK0011160
Ichijo, it looked like you were in a[nl]pretty big hurry just now.
RAK/RAK0045290
No, it's all good now.
RAK/RAK0045300
....Anyway, Onodera. This might seem[nl]like it's out of nowhere, but would you like[nl]to try some of these?
KSK/KSK0011170
Huh? Strawberries?
RAK/RAK0045310
Yeah. They were really good when I tried them,[nl]so I thought I'd bring some for you....
KSK/KSK0011180
....I see.[nl]I'm glad....I'll try some right away.
RAK/RAK0045320
O-Okay. Here's a toothpick.
KSK/KSK0011190
Ah, thanks. Nom.....mmm....
KSK/KSK0011200
Mmmmmmmm~~!
KSK/KSK0011210
Delicious! This is so sweet and tasty!
RAK/RAK0045330
Yeah. I figured you might like strawberries, Onodera.[nl]I'm glad you enjoyed them.
KSK/KSK0011220
I see. Y-You did this for me?
RAK/RAK0045340
Y-Yeah!
@ザクシャ小咲・中
KSK/KSK0011230
Thank you, Ichijo.[nl]I-I'm so happy!
RAK/RAK0045350
(Yesss! That smile![nl] I'm so glad she liked them!)
RAK/RAK0045360
(Shuu, Miyamoto....[nl] Thank you so much!)
