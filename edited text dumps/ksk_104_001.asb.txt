Hey, Ichijo.[nl]Can you help with a math problem? It's a real stumper.
RAK/RAK0045920
Huh, me? I don't really mind,[nl]but aren't you better at schoolwork than I am?
@expose
RUR/RUR0010930
Not mine. Kosaki's math.
RAK/RAK0045930
Huh?

KSK/KSK0011750
Ichijo, I-I'm sorry.[nl]Ruri seems to be busy after this....
RAK/RAK0045940
I-I see.[nl]Of course I'll help you, if I can figure it out.
RUR/RUR0010940
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm counting on you.
KSK/KSK0011760
Um, sorry about this.
RAK/RAK0045950
Don't worry about it.[nl]So, which problem is it?
@expose
KSK/KSK0011770
Ummm, this one right here....
KSK/KSK0011780
I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to use this formula,[nl]but every time I do, the answer comes out weird.
RAK/RAK0045960
I see. Uhhh, if we substitute X once here....
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0045970
(Huh? What's this feeling....?)
KSK/KSK0011790
What's wrong, Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0045980
....Hang on a sec.

WAAAAAAAGH!!!
RAK/RAK0045990
(He sure fell off there quickly.[nl] Jeez, you can never be too careful with that guy....)
RAK/RAK0046000
Hm? What's this?
RAK/RAK0046010
(Let's pick this up, just in case....)
RAK/RAK0056030
(Maybe I should look somewhere else.)
@ksk_104_02
RAK/RAK0046020
....Sorry, Onodera. It was just my imagination.
KSK/KSK0011800
R-Really?
RAK/RAK0046030
Uhh, anyway. This one?[nl]You can use this formula for that one.
KSK/KSK0011810
Umm....so Y moves to the left side....
KSK/KSK0011820
Oh, I get it! I got it, Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0046040
Oh, for real!? That's awesome!
RAK/RAK0046050
Man, here I was wondering what I'd do[nl]if we couldn't figure it out.~.
@ザクシャ小咲・小
KSK/KSK0011830
....I'd still be fine with that.
RAK/RAK0046060
....Huh?
KSK/KSK0011840
....No, it's nothing.[nl]Thanks, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0046070
(I'm glad I could help her....)
CTG/CTG0013520
Look out, darling!
RAK/RAK0046080
Huh!?
@ＨＰ－３０
RAK/RAK0046090
Gwaaagh!
RAK/RAK0046100
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0046110
O-Over there....![nl]Outside the window....that's Claude!
CLD/CLD0001920
Tch....
@背景変更
CTG/CTG0013530
That was a close one....[nl]He was trying to get you!
RAK/RAK0046120
Huh, seriously!?
CTG/CTG0013540
What the hell were you doing?
RAK/RAK0046130
I was just helping Onodera with her homework....
CTG/CTG0013550
Ah, I'll bet that's it.
CTG/CTG0013560
Okay? We're supposed to be lovers. If you start hanging out[nl]with other girls, they might try to come after you.[nl]Don't let your guard down just because we're in school.
RAK/RAK0046140
T-That's unreasonable!!
