Once class starts, we'll be apart.[nl]I want to be as close to you as possible,[nl]even if only for a few fleeting moments, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0081780
So, where do *I* sit?
MRK/MRK0018740
How about on my lap?[nl]Oh, or maybe the other way round?
MRK/MRK0018750
Frankly, the other way round would[nl]excite me much more!
RAK/RAK0081790
We won't do either one!
