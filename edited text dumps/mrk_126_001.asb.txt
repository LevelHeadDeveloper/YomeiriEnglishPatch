Hehehe, it's finally time!
RAK/RAK0079270
I know I promised to do this and all, but....[nl]I didn't think we'd actually do a test of courage.
@expose
MRK/MRK0016240
But I'm sure you're curious too, Raku dearest?[nl]You wonder whether or not there really is a moaning Mona Lisa in the school.
RAK/RAK0079280
It's probably just a prank of some kind,[nl]or someone misheard. Let's just check it out quickly and head home.
MRK/MRK0016250
....You could certainly be a little bit more excited here.
MRK/MRK0016260
You're all alone with a girl in a dark school.[nl]Don't you feel the slightest bit nervous?
RAK/RAK0079290
Again with that kind of talk....[nl]You're not really afraid of ghosts at all, are you.
MRK/MRK0016270
You'll have to wait until we find the ghost to find out.[nl]I'm so scared, I can't leave your side, Raku dearest. ♪
RAK/RAK0079300
(She's not scared at all.)
@時間経過演出
MRK/MRK0016280
Kyaaaah! I'm so scaaaared!
RAK/RAK0079310
Yeah, yeah, but nothing's happened yet,[nl]so get off me.
MRK/MRK0016290
That's a cold response....[nl]But the way you've put it, I can construe that[nl]if something *does* happen, I can feel free to hug you!?
RAK/RAK0079320
Just shut up!
MRK/MRK0016300
Hahh....[nl]Raku dearest, you're the same as ever and that's boring.[nl]I was hoping for more of a suspension-bridge effect.
RAK/RAK0079330
That's just too bad.[nl]This sort of thing doesn't bother me at all.
MRK/MRK0016310
It would have been much more fun to bring[nl]Kirisaki along so I could make fun of her.
RAK/RAK0079340
Don't do that.[nl]She isn't that great with this sort of thing.
MRK/MRK0016320
....Raku dearest, you're awfully soft with Kirisaki.[nl]It's not fair that you'd protect her but not me.
RAK/RAK0079350
Really?[nl]I didn't mean it like that at all....
MRK/MRK0016330
It's okay, you don't need to hide it.[nl]You two are in a relationship, after all.[nl]But only for now!
MRK/MRK0016340
But, it's just for now!
RAK/RAK0079360
W-What are you suddenly so mad about?
MRK/MRK0016350
I'm just saying, even I get jealous sometimes.[nl]Hmph!
RAK/RAK0079370
We're almost to the art room.[nl]I haven't heard any voices so far....
MRK/MRK0016360
I think we need to go inside.
RAK/RAK0079380
But aren't these rooms usually kept locked anyway?[nl]Here.... See what I--
RAK/RAK0079390
Huh....?
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
MRK/MRK0016370
....It opened.
RAK/RAK0079400
T-The teacher must have forgotten to lock it.
MRK/MRK0016380
That must have been it. To be honest, I don't think[nl]there's a ghost either, so--
OTM/OTM0008070
....Whoo.... whooo....
RAK/RAK0079410G
!?!?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0079420
W-What was that!?
OTM/OTM0008080
Whooo..... Whoooo....
MRK/MRK0016400
I-It came from inside the....art room.[nl]Could it be....the Mona Lisa ghost is real!?
RAK/RAK0079430
Hahaha.... No way, that can't be right![nl]Sounds like these always turn out to be a draft or something.
MRK/MRK0016410
But there's no wind....
OTM/OTM0008090
Whaaaaaa......![nl]Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.....!
MRK/MRK0016420
Kyaaaah!
OTM/OTM0008100
AAAAAAAAAAA!
MRK/MRK0016430
I-I-It's getting louder and louder!)
RAK/RAK0079440
(Dammit! What should I do!?)
Run away with Marika
Leave Marika and find who's moaning
RAK/RAK0079450
Tachibana! We can't just stand around here![nl]Let's get outta here for now!
MRK/MRK0016440
Raku dearest, Raku deeaaaresst!
RAK/RAK0079460
Here, grab my hand! Let's go!
@ザクシャ万里花・中
@expose2
MRK/MRK0016450
O-Okay...!
OTM/OTM0008110
Aaaaa.....?[nl]Raaaaku....?
MRK/MRK0016460
N-No! Don't leave me here by myself!
RAK/RAK0079480
Wh--!?[nl]Stop hugging me.
MRK/MRK0016470
Pleeeaaase! Raaaku deeearesst!
RAK/RAK0079490
Okay, fine![nl]I won't go, so calm down!
@ザクシャ万里花・小
MRK/MRK0016480
*Sob*....[nl]Raku dearest....
RAK/RAK0079500
There, there....[nl]Alright, let's get outta here.
MRK/MRK0016490
Okay....[nl]*sniffle*
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0079510
....I think we're far enough away now[nl]that we should be fine.
RAK/RAK0079520
Don't worry, Tachibana. We can't hear it anymore,[nl]and I doubt that ghost is leaving the art room.
MRK/MRK0016500
T-Thank you so much.[nl]*sob*.... I never thought there'd actually be a ghost....
RAK/RAK0079530
I guess even you'd get scared[nl]from running into that thing.
RAK/RAK0079540
(To be honest, I'm a bit scared myself.[nl] If I can help it, I don't wanna tangle with that thing again.)
MRK/MRK0016510
....Let's get the police in here.
RAK/RAK0079550
Huh!?
MRK/MRK0016520
We can't just let something that scary roam unchecked![nl]I'll have Honda call in the national riot police, district riot police,[nl]and the special vehicles unit!
MRK/MRK0016530
I'll make that ghost regret the day it scared me!
MRK/MRK0016540
THIS IS WAR!!
RAK/RAK0079560
Hey, hey, calm down![nl]You're thinking too much like Tsugumi!
MRK/MRK0016550
B-But....
RAK/RAK0079570
If you do that, it'll be catastrophic to the point[nl]we couldn't even go to school!
RAK/RAK0079580
Anyway, let's get out of here for the day.[nl]I'll walk you home.
MRK/MRK0016560
....I'm still scared, can you hold my hand?
RAK/RAK0079590
Sure, just for today.
MRK/MRK0016570
....In that case, I'll hold off on taking back[nl]the art room for now.
MRK/MRK0016580
But I'm never going near the school at night again.
RAK/RAK0079600
That'd be great.[nl]For your sake and the school's....
