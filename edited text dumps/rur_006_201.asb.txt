RUR/RUR0007000
That was a pretty good fight....[nl]But not good enough to make me submit.
RUR/RUR0007020
Come on, why don't you just give up?[nl]There's nothing wrong with being in a world of glasses.
RUR/RUR0007030
Apparently, you don't have much to say against it.
RUR/RUR0007050
You're convinced now, aren't you?[nl]There's nothing wrong with being in a world of glasses.
I'm convinced.
I'm not convinced.

RUR/RUR0007060
Ah, I see....
RUR/RUR0007070
Well then, I'll explain it from the beginning.[nl]Unplug your ears and let me tell you[nl]all about the beauty of glasses.

RUR/RUR0007080
You argue quite vehemently, Ichijo.[nl]Why do you hate the glasses-world so much?
RAK/RAK0033630
Well, I wouldn't say I don't like glasses. But....
RAK/RAK0033640
....Miyamoto. I have a question for you.[nl]How can a woman like you sympathize with[nl]a world like this one?
RUR/RUR0007090
Because I've always worn glasses.[nl]I don't see anything wrong with a world full of--
RAK/RAK0033650
That's not what I meant![nl]You know how this world came into being!
RAK/RAK0033660
And I'm asking how you can be okay with that!
RUR/RUR0007100
How this world came into being....?
RAK/RAK0033670
It's because a certain idiot kept[nl]saying this word!
@ＢＧＭ再生
RUR/RUR0007110
What are you talking about?
RUR/RUR0007120
If you can't remember,[nl]then it isn't a big deal.
RAK/RAK0033680
No, wait! I'm trying to remember!
RAK/RAK0033690
Ummm, uhhhhhh....!

SYU/SYU0005720
Raku, time's up.
RAK/RAK0033700
Huh?
SYU/SYU0005730
Look outside.[nl]The sun finished setting just now.
SYU/SYU0005740
And I'm suddenly intensely embarrassed....[nl]Sorry, I'll put my glasses back on, too.
RAK/RAK0033710
Oh....n-no way....
RAK/RAK0033720
(I mean, I'm getting really embarrassed too....)
RAK/RAK0033730
I'm still not sure how to feel about this![nl]G-Glasses, glasses!!
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0033750
Crap. Frustratingly, it looks like[nl]Miyamoto was too persistent....
RUR/RUR0007140
There's nothing to be frustrated about.
RUR/RUR0007150
There's nothing wrong with letting this glasses-world[nl]continue as it is.

RUR/RUR0007160
----!
RUR/RUR0007170
That's right....
RUR/RUR0007180
This glasses-infested world started as[nl]a manifestation of Maiko's wish.
RUR/RUR0007190
Then it's like I was just doing everything I could[nl]to defend his nonsensical desires....
RUR/RUR0007200
Aaaaagh.....I feel sick![nl]How could I have been so stupid....[nl]To succumb to a false sense of shame!?
SYU/SYU0005750
Hahaha.....[nl]There's no need to look so obviously disgusted~, Ruri.
RAK/RAK0033760
Miyamoto, have you snapped out of it?
RUR/RUR0007210
Yeah....that was awful....
RUR/RUR0007220
I'm sorry, Ichijo. I'd lost control for a while there.[nl]I'll take off my glasses now.
SYU/SYU0005760
Huh!? You were so stubborn about it just now,[nl]but you'll take them off just because of that!?[nl]That's not so bad!
RUR/RUR0007230
Shut up! I'm tired of being influenced[nl]by your vile desires.
RUR/RUR0007240
....Hmph!
RAK/RAK0033770
(Oh, she took them off with zero hesitation....)
RUR/RUR0007250
Alright, can we go back to normal, already?[nl]I, for one, would like to leave this[nl]crazy-glasses-fetish-world as soon as possible.
SYU/SYU0005770
W-What a terrible thing to say....
RAK/RAK0033790
Hey, Otama!
OTM/OTM0002270
Mhm. It would seem that, with moments to spare,[nl]thou hast removed the glasses from seven people.
OTM/OTM0002280
Well then, I shall undo the wish....[nl]Doth any of thee have any objections?
SYU/SYU0005780
Oh, wait a sec!
RAK/RAK0033800
What's wrong, Shuu?
SYU/SYU0005790
Well, I just realized I hadn't taken any pictures at all,[nl]even though the world was full of girls with glasses.[nl]Let me just take a picture of the swim team right--
@expose2
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0005800
....Glckbth!
RUR/RUR0007260
Hurry up and change it back.
OTM/OTM0002290
Mhm. Everyone, close thine eyes.[nl]Go on, return to nooormaaaal!

RAK/RAK0033810
Hm....?
RUR/RUR0007270
We're back....I think.[nl]Nothing seems to have changed.
SYU/SYU0005810
Oh, but look, the swimmers coming out of the locker room[nl]don't seem to be wearing glasses.
RAK/RAK0033820
Oh, that's true.[nl]Looks like we're back to normal, then.
SYU/SYU0005820
Mmmmm, the naked eye seems so fresh,[nl]coming back from the glasses world.
SYU/SYU0005830
Alright, to commemorate our safe return, Ruri,[nl]smile for the camera!
RUR/RUR0007280
Whaaa....![nl]Why are you pointing a camera at me all of a sudden!?
SYU/SYU0005840
Well, ya know. We're back to normal now,[nl]so I'd like at least one picture of a beautiful girl[nl]without glasses as a souvenir.
RAK/RAK0033830
You....never learn, do you.
RUR/RUR0007290
Hey, Maiko.[nl]Do you really think I'd let you take a picture of me?
RUR/RUR0007300
I can't see even five centimeters without my glasses.[nl]So I'm done not wearing them.
SYU/SYU0005850
Awww, you're gonna wear your glasses again?[nl]Your naked eyes were so precious to me.
RAK/RAK0033840
You went on and on and on about girls with glasses,[nl]and now you're all over girls *without* glasses.[nl]You're really capricious.
SYU/SYU0005860
Well, after being completely surrounded[nl]by people with glasses, even I've had my fill. Hahahaha.
RUR/RUR0007310
What do you mean "Hahahaha"? Jeez.
RAK/RAK0033850
(Anyway, it's good to be back in this world....)
@エンディング
SYU/SYU0005870
Maaaan, I really love girls with glasses~.
RAK/RAK0033860
(That's not what you were saying yesterday at all!)
KSK/KSK0008510
Hey, Maiko.[nl]How long do I have to stand here wearing these glasses?
SYU/SYU0005880
Oh, sorry, I just need 2, maybe 3 more shots.[nl]Hehe, these are gonna fetch a good price for sure.
RUR/RUR0007320
Maiko, tell me again what you're making Kosaki do.
SYU/SYU0005890
Huh? What do you mean,[nl]obviously she's modeling for a glasses-girl-photo-b---
@画面揺らし
SYU/SYU0005900
WAAAAAAGH! RURI![nl]YOU BROKE ANOTHER CAMERAAAAAAAAA!!
RUR/RUR0007330
Ichijo, you should have stopped him.
RAK/RAK0033870
Well, I tried to stop him,[nl]but he kept absolutely insisting on taking a picture[nl]of Onodera wearing glasses.
RAK/RAK0033890
I figured it would be a problem if he tried sneaking a photo,[nl]so I'm having him take one where we can all see him.
RUR/RUR0007340
You haven't improved at all. Jeez....
RUR/RUR0007350
I might as well stop wearing glasses. I think I'd rather[nl]wear contacts than have Maiko looking at me like a perv....
RAK/RAK0033900
Really? I think you look better with glasses, Miyamoto.
RAK/RAK0033910
I saw a lot of people wearing glasses yesterday,[nl]but I think yours suited you the most.
RUR/RUR0007360
......Hmmmm.....I see.
RUR/RUR0007370
Well, if you say so, I guess it's alright....
RUR/RUR0007380
....Ichijo.
