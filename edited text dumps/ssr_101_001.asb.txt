Ahhh, it feels great to be on the roof.
RAK/RAK0052570
I figure it isn't so bad to eat lunch alone once in a while,[nl]and I think I've found the right place for that. Hehehe....
SSR/SSR0012000
....Why are you snickering to yourself like that?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0052580
Aaaagh! T-Tsugumi!?[nl]Why are you here!?
SSR/SSR0012010
The Mistress and Onodera are eating lunch with the[nl]swim team, so we separated for lunch today.
RAK/RAK0052590
How come? Why don't you eat together?
@expose
SSR/SSR0012020
The Mistress is having a good time with her friends.[nl]I don't want to get in the way of that.
SSR/SSR0012030
Besides, it's such a lovely day.[nl]I figured I might as well eat outside.
RAK/RAK0052600
Hmmmm....[nl]So you had the same idea I did.
Invite her to eat with you
Eat separately
RAK/RAK0052610
Alright, then let's eat quickly.
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0012040
Mhm. Good idea.....
SSR/SSR0012050
Wait, hang on! Why are you sitting so close to me!?[nl]I-It's just the two of us here!![nl]We shouldn't be doing something like this....
RAK/RAK0052620
I don't know what you're talking about, but eat this[nl]and calm down. Here.
SSR/SSR0012060
Mmpgh!? What the hell are you....[nl]....Nom nom.
SSR/SSR0012070
.....T-This is delicious![nl]What the hell is it?
RAK/RAK0052630
Hehehe.....that was my special Japanese omelet![nl]I'm quite proud of how it came out today.
SSR/SSR0012080
Hmmmm....this is the first time I've eaten your cooking,[nl]and I gotta say it's pretty good.[nl].....What's this over here?
RAK/RAK0052640
Oh, that's called "you lin ji".[nl]It's lower in calories than fried chicken,[nl]but it's crispy and tasty all the same.
RAK/RAK0052650
Go on, try some of the others.
SSR/SSR0012090
Ngh....even for you, Raku Ichijo,[nl]this is awfully intricately made.[nl]Even so....it's delicious.
SSR/SSR0012100
And the rice is strangely fluffy, considering how it's packed.[nl]How did you prepare it?
RAK/RAK0052660
I took freshly-cooked rice and let it cool[nl]before packing it. That's a piece of wisdom I learned[nl]from my many years making lunchboxes.
SSR/SSR0012110
Ghh....I can't stop my chopsticks![nl]And it's Raku Ichijo's cooking, no less.....[nl]I can't believe I'm giving in to this guy's cooking!
SSR/SSR0012120
D-Don't go thinking you've won, Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0052670
Bold words after eating so much....
RAK/RAK0052680
By the way, is that your lunchbox?[nl]Did you make it yourself, by any chance?
SSR/SSR0012130
Well, pretty much.
RAK/RAK0052690
Ooooh, lemme try some of that.[nl]We'll share our lunches.
SSR/SSR0012140
S-Share!?
SSR/SSR0012150
N-No way![nl]There's absolutely no way we're doing that!
RAK/RAK0052700
Awww....why not?[nl]Just a little should be fine.
SSR/SSR0012160
Well, this morning's been pretty hectic, so I'm not sure how[nl]well put-together this is, and after you showed me your[nl]lunch, I'm not confident in how mine stacks up....
RAK/RAK0052710
Don't worry about that! I don't have many other friends[nl]who can cook. We've gotta exchance opinions....
SSR/SSR0012170
Who said we were friends!?
SSR/SSR0012180
Don't get the wrong idea, Raku Ichijo![nl]You and I are enemies!
SSR/SSR0012190
I-I don't know how we could get along well enough[nl]to be sharing our lunches!
RAK/RAK0052720
Oh, w-wait a second![nl]Don't take my lunch, too!
RAK/RAK0052730
Hey, Tsugumi! Tsugumi!?[nl].....Come baaaack!
RAK/RAK0052740
....Huh?[nl]I guess I'm.....not eating my lunch today, then?
RAK/RAK0052750
.....Seriously?
RAK/RAK0052760
Alright, I'll eat over here, then.
SSR/SSR0012200
I-I see....
RAK/RAK0052770
Hm? Did you want to eat with me?
SSR/SSR0012210
I refuse!!
SSR/SSR0012220
Even a good lunch would taste bad[nl]if I ate it with you!
RAK/RAK0052780
You didn't need to go that far....
RAK/RAK0052790
Oh, hang on.[nl]Tsugumi, get your lunch box out.
SSR/SSR0012230
B-But I told you I'm not eating with---!
RAK/RAK0052800
Here, this is a dish I highly recommend.[nl]I'll give you mine.
SSR/SSR0012240
Is this....an omelette?[nl]But it smells like bonito broth....
RAK/RAK0052810
Oh, you noticed. It's my Japanese-style omelet.[nl]I think it turned out well.
SSR/SSR0012250
I see....[nl]Thanks for sharing, then.
RAK/RAK0052820
See ya.
SSR/SSR0012260
W-Wait! Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0052830
Hm?
SSR/SSR0012270
I don't have any intention of owing you anything.[nl].....So, here, you can have this insignificant thing....
RAK/RAK0052840
Ohh, hamburger steak.[nl]....It definitely looks....homemeade.
SSR/SSR0012280
I-I ran out of time making lunch this morning![nl]I'm not usually this bad at cooking!
RAK/RAK0052850
Hahaha, sorry, sorry.[nl]I shouldn't have been so picky with a gift.
RAK/RAK0052860
I guess we should eat together, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0012290
.....H-Hmph. I guess it can't be helped!
@ザクシャ誠士郎・小
RAK/RAK0052870
(You're lonely eating by yourself,[nl] but you're not being honest about it at all....)
