I really like talking to you, Ichijo.....It's fun.

RAK/RAK0009330
(I have to try to lift the mood![nl] Ummm, umm.....)
RAK/RAK0009340
Hey, Onodera. Wanna stop by that park?[nl]There's a bench so we can sit down and talk.
KSK/KSK0003550
Ah-....Y-Yes!

Looks like they're all having fun.
RAK/RAK0009350
Yeah. I used to play like that a lot.
KSK/KSK0003570
Oh, their ball....
RAK/RAK0009360
I think it belongs to that kid. Lemme give him a wave.
@expose
KSK/KSK0003580
I'll bring it over in a bit.
RAK/RAK0009370
No, it's good.[nl]I think I can throw it far enough.
KSK/KSK0003590
Ah, I see.[nl]Well, go ahead.
RAK/RAK0009380
Okay.
RAK/RAK0009390
Hey, go long!!
RAK/RAK0009400
Alright, nice catch!
KSK/KSK0003600
---------.
RAK/RAK0009410
Hm? What's wrong, Onodera?
KSK/KSK0003610
You threw that ball farther than I expected.[nl]I don't think I could've done that.
RAK/RAK0009420
Well, I am a man.[nl]I should be able to throw pretty far.
KSK/KSK0003620
.....Yeah, that's right.[nl]You are a boy, after all.
RAK/RAK0009430
(....It's kind of embarassing to hear Onodera say that again.)
@expose
KSK/KSK0003630
Those kids are cute, aren't they.
RAK/RAK0009440
Well, you seem to be good with kids.
KSK/KSK0003640
Yes. Both my parents work,[nl]so I used to take care of my sister.
RAK/RAK0009450
I see....
RAK/RAK0009460
(So, if I were to have a child with Onodera....)
RAK/RAK0009470
(Uwahhh, that would make me so happy~.....)
KSK/KSK0003650
Ah-, the girl fell down!
RAK/RAK0009480
Huh, really!?
KSK/KSK0003660
I have a bandage, I'll go fix her up!
RAK/RAK0009490
(Onodera is great at taking care of people like this....)
RAK/RAK0009500
(The girl who fell down is smiling.)
KSK/KSK0003670
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0009510
No, it's fine.[nl]She seems like she's doing better.
KSK/KSK0003680
Yeah, it was just a couple scratches.
RAK/RAK0009520
Thank goodness.
RAK/RAK0009530
I....think you're amazing at that kind of thing, Onodera.
KSK/KSK0003690
Eh?
RAK/RAK0009540
Well, it's not easy to do that, is it?[nl]To comfort a crying child, or even to get them to laugh.
KSK/KSK0003700
Not at all![nl]It's just a normal thing....
RAK/RAK0009550
No, it's amazing. I guarantee it!
RAK/RAK0009560
....I mean, if that's the sort of thing I can guarantee.
KSK/KSK0003710
N-No! It's not true!
KSK/KSK0003720
I'm really very happy....
RAK/RAK0009570
--------!
RAK/RAK0009580
(This atmosphere....Is it just my imagination, or is it really[nl]this good?)
RAK/RAK0009590
(It really feels like a casual after-school date this way....)
KSK/KSK0003730
....That's right.[nl]Ichijo, you were talking about getting some groceries earlier.[nl]Can you make it in time after talking with me for so long?
RAK/RAK0009600
Oh, sure![nl]There's still plenty of time before the supermarket closes,[nl]and I'm making a pretty quick meal today.
KSK/KSK0003740
Okay, that's good.
KSK/KSK0003750
...I do envy your family, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0009610
Huh? How come?
KSK/KSK0003760
Well, your cooking is delicious, and I kind of envy them[nl]for being able to eat it every day.
RAK/RAK0009620
Huh?[nl]Do you want to eat my cooking everyday?
KSK/KSK0003770
Hm? Yes, I think so....?
RAK/RAK0009630
(Awesome.....!)
RAK/RAK0009640
(Doesn't that sound like an old Japanese marriage proposal?[nl]"Make me miso soup every day" or something.)
RAK/RAK0009650
(No, no.....[nl] I'm totally overthinking this.[nl] Onodera looks kind of confused....)
KSK/KSK0003780
----------?
KSK/KSK0003790
Ahh!?
KSK/KSK0003800
N-No![nl]That's not what I meant at all!
RAK/RAK0009660
Ah, ahaha.....[nl]No, I got it, I got it.
KSK/KSK0003810
KSK/KSK0003820
....But, um.....
RAK/RAK0009670
....Hm?
KSK/KSK0003830
I do actually wish I could eat your cooking every day.
RAK/RAK0009680
Ah- Ohh.....
RAK/RAK0009690
(I'm not so vain as to believe Onodera[nl] wants to marry me, but...)
RAK/RAK0009700
(But still....)
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0009710
.......Onodera.
KSK/KSK0003840
......Y-Yes?
RAK/RAK0009720
....I'd be fine with cooking for you every day.
KSK/KSK0003850
Huh?
RAK/RAK0009730
I can make you at least one meal a day.
KSK/KSK0003860
.....Ehe.....
RAK/RAK0009740
I......
RAK/RAK0009750
Onodera, I----!

Oh, it's the thugs from the Shuei-Gumi.[nl]My deepest apologies. I couldn't see your weak aura.
RYU/RYU0000150
Oho, a weakling like you is talking?
CLD/CLD0000460
Oh, did I say something offensive? I'm sorry.[nl]I just had to throw up after breathing the same[nl]air as you nauseating pigs.
CLD/CLD0000470G

RAK/RAK0009780
Ah, y-yes.[nl]I'm fine....
RAK/RAK0009790
(Have the kids all run away....?[nl] Well, duh....)
RAK/RAK0009800
(Hah-...! If they see me with Onodera like this,[nl] they'll get the wrong idea and I might be in[nl] even bigger trouble...!?)
RAK/RAK0009810
Onodera, come here for a sec!
KSK/KSK0003880
Huh!? O-Okay....!?
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0009820

KSK/KSK0003900

You fool. I'll send you to hell!
RAK/RAK0009890
RAK/RAK0009900
Sorry, Onodera. Hang tight for a sec.
KSK/KSK0003970
Ah, okay....got it.[nl]Be careful, okay?
RYU/RYU0000180
So this is war, then!
CLD/CLD0000490
Fine by me....[nl]You're gonna be the ones to regret it, though!
RAK/RAK0009910
Hey![nl]What the hell are you guys doing!!
RYU/RYU0000190
Y-Young master!![nl]When did you get here!?
RAK/RAK0009920
Claude, why are you here in the first place![nl]Look! All the kids were so scared that they[nl]scurried away like ants!
CLD/CLD0000500
.....They provoked me first, though.
RYU/RYU0000200
Ohh, what the hell, man!
CLD/CLD0000510
I'm saying it's all your fault, monkey.
RAK/RAK0009930
(Crap. I'll never have a pleasant conversation with Onodera[nl]at this rate!
RAK/RAK0009940
Aghhh, fine![nl]We were in the wrong today![nl]Could you please stay off this street, just for today?
RYU/RYU0000210
Young master, no![nl]Please don't bow to them on our behalf!
CLD/CLD0000520
...Heh.
CLD/CLD0000530
We'll pull out for today.[nl]Move out, boys.
RYU/RYU0000240
Ugh-, Young master....[nl]I'm....sorry about that.....
RAK/RAK0009960
Okay, but try to avoid fighting, alright?[nl]You should be sorry!
RYU/RYU0000260
Y-Young master....!
RYU/RYU0000270
What confidence![nl]I always knew you were the best young man in the world....[nl]No, the universe~!!
RAK/RAK0009970
Oh....[nl]Thank you for the excessive praise.
RAK/RAK0009980
Oh, that's right.[nl]Ryuu, do you have some time to go shopping for dinner?[nl]Let's see....I've got a list for you here.
RYU/RYU0000280
Right! As you wish-!!
RAK/RAK0009990
(Alright, they're gone....)
RAK/RAK0010000
Sorry, Onodera.[nl]Thanks for waiting....
KSK/KSK0003980
No, it's alright.[nl]Thanks for your hard work, Ichijo!
KSK/KSK0003990
It's honestly amazing that you can mediate between such[nl]scary-looking people.
RAK/RAK0010010
N-No....[nl]It isn't really that cool or anything....
KSK/KSK0004000
No! That was very cool!
RAK/RAK0010020
Hm!?
RAK/RAK0010030
(Onodera thought I was cool....)
KSK/KSK0004010
Ah-....umm....[nl]Uh......
KSK/KSK0004020
Th-That's right![nl]Ichijo, what was it you were trying to say earlier?
RAK/RAK0010040
...When?
RAK/RAK0010050
(....Ah! I was about to confess to her!)
RAK/RAK0010060
Uhh....Hmmm.....
RAK/RAK0010070
(What should I tell her.....)
RAK/RAK0010080
