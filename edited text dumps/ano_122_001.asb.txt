Hanako-san of the Toilet, the Mona Lisa, the human body[nl]model.... Not counting that "future-partner" thing[nl]Chitoge mentioned, of course....
RAK/RAK0064770
I never thought those three ghost stories I thought[nl]were just rumors would actually exist.
RAK/RAK0064780
Well, we do have yokai like Otama, too,[nl]so it's not like it was all that surprising.

OTM/OTM0006240
Thou has summoned me, Raku?
RAK/RAK0064790
Blrrrf! I-I didn't summon you![nl]I mean, haven't I told you countless times[nl]not to come to school!?
OTM/OTM0006250
Yes, but for a mere human such as thyself[nl]to try to order me around is quite cheeky.
RAK/RAK0064800
If you don't start listening to me,[nl]I'll never make you inari sushi again.
@expose
OTM/OTM0006260
T-That's not faaiiir!
RAK/RAK0064810
Then go home and stay there quietly.[nl]When you come here, I'm scared you'll make trouble.
OTM/OTM0006270
So rude! I'm not just here to haveth fun, 'k?[nl]This is part of my training, too!
RAK/RAK0064820
Training?
OTM/OTM0006280
That is correct![nl]There are a good many girls in this school[nl]who are into horr-or.
RAK/RAK0064830
Horror? ....Oh, I know what you mean. You're talking about[nl]the Seven Wonders, they were all the rage until just the[nl]other day. But what does that have to do with trai--
RAK/RAK0064840
....Wait just a second, I'm starting do understand.[nl]Don't tell me you....!
OTM/OTM0006290
Right, right, everyone wanted to see the Seven Wonders, right?[nl]So I helped that along using my divine powers just in the nick of time.
OTM/OTM0006300
Whaaat, there's no need to thanketh me.[nl]'Twas the least I could do!
RAK/RAK0064850
....No more inari sushi for you.
@expose
OTM/OTM0006310
Why not!?
RAK/RAK0064860
You idiot! Do you not realize[nl]how much trouble you've caused me!?
RAK/RAK0064870
Tachibana tried to destroy the whole school[nl]because she heard the Mona Lisa moaning!
OTM/OTM0006320
It took a lot of effort to pull off that voice.[nl]But wasn't the performance convincing indeed?
RAK/RAK0064880
And Tsugumi tried to destroy the bathrooms,[nl]I'm not even joking!
OTM/OTM0006330
Mhm. I do enjoy banging doors as hard as I can.[nl]Maybe I haveth a talent for being a ghost!
RAK/RAK0064890
Stop acting smug about it!
RAK/RAK0064900
It certainly wasn't cool to move the human body model[nl]around, either! Onodera and I both ended up[nl]shaking in fear!
@ＢＧＭ停止
OTM/OTM0006340
Human body mo-del?[nl]What is that?
RAK/RAK0064910
What do you mean?[nl]You were the one moving it, right?
OTM/OTM0006350
I knoweth not what thou meaneth....[nl]But I only did Hanako-san and the Mo-na Li-sa, okay?
RAK/RAK0064920
Right, right. Quit trying to scare me like that.[nl]If you don't own up to it and apologize, no more[nl]inari sushi for you.
OTM/OTM0006360
Honest, honest![nl]I sweareth I knoweth nothing about it!
RAK/RAK0064930
Then you're saying the human body model was a real ghost?[nl]Haha, what a terrible joke.
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0064940
You're the one making that noise, right?[nl]It's a good trick, but a bit overkill for a prank.
OTM/OTM0006370
R-Raku....'tis not the time for this.[nl]Let us escape post-haste!
RAK/RAK0064950
Hey, quit trying to dodge the question![nl]Trying to avoid answering questions like that is just--
OTM/OTM0006380
Eeeeeek! It's all over![nl]I'm getting out of here! A-A strange person approacheth!
RAK/RAK0064960
Oh, hey! Hey!
RAK/RAK0064970
Good grief, what a complicated prank.
RAK/RAK0064980
Hey, Otama. I know you're the one behind this![nl]When I get home, we're going to have a long talk about this,[nl]so get ready!
RAK/RAK0064990
Jeez!
