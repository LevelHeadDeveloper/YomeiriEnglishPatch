RAK/RAK0028310
Phew! Today's finally over....
RAK/RAK0028320
....Hm? What's this?
RAK/RAK0028330
A DVD of "Meowsville 2"....[nl]What's this doing on my desk?
CTG/CTG0009510
Oh, that.[nl]Isn't that the DVD you mentioned earlier?
RAK/RAK0028340
Hm?
CTG/CTG0009520
You know, "Meowsville 2".[nl]The one you were saying would make you cry to death.
RAK/RAK0028350
Yeah, I guess it is.[nl]I don't know why it's on my desk, though.
RAK/RAK0028360
Maybe Shuu put it there? I'd asked him earlier[nl]to lend it to me if he had it.
CTG/CTG0009530
Hey, that's surprising.[nl]I didn't think he'd be into that kind of movie.
RAK/RAK0028370
I don't think it's that surprising[nl]Meowsville 2 is a huge blockbuster movie.[nl]All kinds of people watch it.
@expose
CTG/CTG0009540
Hmmm....is that right?[nl]I'm not really into that kind of thing myself.
RAK/RAK0028380
Yeah, I know.[nl]Man, I'm sorry I can't share[nl]my excitement about this with you
CTG/CTG0009550
Mgh!
CTG/CTG0009560
Hmmph. I prefer flashier, easy-to-understand movies anyway.
........
CTG/CTG0009570
Hey, Raku.
RAK/RAK0028390
CTG/CTG0009580
Can I borrow that DVD, just for today?
RAK/RAK0028400
Huh? I thought you didn't like it.
CTG/CTG0009590
No, that's true. But tonight, Tsugumi, Kosaki, Ruri[nl]and I are having a pajama party at my place.
CTG/CTG0009600
So I'm looking for a movie we can all enjoy.
CTG/CTG0009610
Meowsville 2 is a touching animal fantasy movie, right?[nl]I think Kosaki might enjoy that kind of thing.
RAK/RAK0028410
Well, this film is a tear-jerker for any animal lover.[nl]I guarantee it.
CTG/CTG0009620
Really?[nl]Sounds like just the thing for everyone to watch.
RAK/RAK0028420
Well then, I'll let you have this first.[nl]It would be subletting, but as long as I tell Shuu,[nl]it shouldn't be a problem.
CTG/CTG0009630
Alright, I'll borrow it. Thanks!
RAK/RAK0028430
Yeah, see you around.
RAK/RAK0028440
(A slumber party with Onodera, huh.[nl] To be honest, I'm jealous....)
RAK/RAK0028450
Aaagh, I also wanna watch Meowsville 2[nl]with Onodera and talk about it....
SYU/SYU0002500
Yo. What's wrong, Raku?[nl]You're sighing and you've got a faraway look in your eyes.
RAK/RAK0028460
Oh, Shuu.
RAK/RAK0028470
You're the one who put that DVD on my desk, right?[nl]Thanks. I've been looking forward to it.
SYU/SYU0002510
No, no, don't worry about it.[nl]We're friends after all.
SYU/SYU0002520
So, I hope you enjoy that [nl]super-special DVD very much tonight.
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0028480
Yeah, I wi---
RAK/RAK0028490
What did you just say?
SYU/SYU0002530
Huh? I hope you enjoy that[nl]super-special DVD very much tonight.....
RAK/RAK0028500
Haha, what are you talking about?[nl]It's just Meowsville 2....
SYU/SYU0002540
Tsk, tsk. The case was just a disguise.[nl]What's inside is a funny movie you can't show anyone.
RAK/RAK0028510
F-Funny movie!?
SYU/SYU0002550
Onodera nodding off in her chair in class,[nl]Kirisaki secretly eating her lunch before lunchtime,[nl]Ruri drawing very dramatically in her textbook....
SYU/SYU0002560
And besides all that, there's things I don't think[nl]I can even say out loud....
SYU/SYU0002570
I filmed and edited the[nl]"Somewhat Embarrassing Scenes in Everyday Life"[nl]for this class's beautiful girls.
RAK/RAK0028520
So you took videos without their knowledge....
SYU/SYU0002580
I took videos without their knowledge?[nl]What are you talking about, are you listening at all?
SYU/SYU0002590
I simply filmed them without telling them.[nl]That way, they're in their natural state....isn't that lovely?
RAK/RAK0028530
What's lovely about it, you idiot!?[nl]What were you thinking, putting that[nl]dangerous DVD on my desk!?
SYU/SYU0002600
Because, Raku, you're a comrade on the[nl]beautiful-girl-photo-book project. I figured I'd[nl]share some of my results.
SYU/SYU0002610
Well, I can assure you of the quality.[nl]I hope you enjoy Onodera's and Kirisaki's[nl]"Embarrassing Scenes" to the fullest.
RAK/RAK0028540
Sorry, Shuu, I can't do that.[nl]I don't have the DVD anymore.
SYU/SYU0002620
Huh? What do you mean?
RAK/RAK0028550
Chitoge borrowed it just now.[nl]She thought it was "Meowsville 2".[nl]She's going to watch it with Onodera and Miyamoto tonight.
SYU/SYU0002630
For real....?
RAK/RAK0028560
For real.
SYU/SYU0002640
But if the girls see those movies,[nl]then you and I will be ostracized by our class!
RAK/RAK0028570
Aagh, that's true![nl]What the hell have you done, you sone of a bitch!?
RAK/RAK0028580
First of all, you shouldn't have given it to me[nl]in such an exciting DVD case!
SYU/SYU0002650
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down, Raku.[nl]It's because it's so dangerous that I had to disguise it.
SYU/SYU0002660
Besides, they haven't seen what's inside, right?[nl]So you should be able to handle it.
RAK/RAK0028590
Handle it how?
SYU/SYU0002670
Simple, really.[nl]Just retrieve the DVD before they see it.
