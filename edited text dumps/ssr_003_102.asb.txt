Also, I loved the scene where Shichi visited the[nl]train station every single day to wait for his master.
Thoughts on that scene?
That scene moved me.
I must've missed it.

The sight of Shichi's dull eyes as he sits[nl]waiting for his master will make that[nl]scene one of the most famous in cinema history!

What? You missed it because you were too busy[nl]looking at the mistress's sleeping face, you say!?
SSR/SSR0003520
Why were you staring at her like that![nl]And in the dark, no less....you pervert!
