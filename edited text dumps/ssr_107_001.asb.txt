Oh, so I found this one store yesterday....

Hahh.....

(Tsugumi's not engaging in conversation with them[nl] this time, either.... It can't be helped.)
Give her a push
Leave her alone

!
RAK/RAK0053800
Come on, stop worrying and get over there.
SSR/SSR0013170
Huh...? I-I wouldn't say I'm really worried....
SSR/SSR0013180
I already told you.[nl]If I get too close to them, it will only[nl]make it harder for me to leave them behind.
RAK/RAK0053810
You're not the only one who has trouble[nl]saying their goodbyes.
SSR/SSR0013190
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0053820
We'll be graduating in just two years,[nl]and I'm certain some of us won't be[nl]seeing each other again.
RAK/RAK0053830
But you're wasting precious time by not talking[nl]to them for just that reason, right?[nl]You need to lighten up a bit about making friends.
SSR/SSR0013200
But....
RAK/RAK0053840
Besides, you'll have a lot more memories with Chitoge[nl]and the others, and that'll be more fun, right?
SSR/SSR0013210
Ah.....
SSR/SSR0013220
I see.... You've certainly got a point there....
RAK/RAK0053850
If you really think so, stop moping[nl]and go mingle with the others.
RAK/RAK0053860
Heeey, Chitoge!
SSR/SSR0013230
Waaagh, hey!
CTG/CTG0013960
What? You called?
RAK/RAK0053870
Tsugumi's interested in what you're talking about!
CTG/CTG0013970
Oh, really? Then you should've come over here[nl]instead of standing there talking to my darling or someone.
RAK/RAK0053880
The hell do you mean "or someone"?
CTG/CTG0013980
Come on, Tsugumi. Let's talk together.
SSR/SSR0013240
Ghh....alright. Thanks for offering....
SSR/SSR0013250
You....I won't forget this.
RAK/RAK0053890
Aaagh! Please don't make such a scary face.
RAK/RAK0053900
Okay, maybe I was nosing in a *little*....
SSR/SSR0013260
Jeez. You're always doing such uncalled-for things....
RAK/RAK0053910
Save the lecture for later. Just get going.
SSR/SSR0013270
O-Okay....
SSR/SSR0013280
....Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0053920
Hm?
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0013290
Well....thank you.
RAK/RAK0053930
....Huh? What did you say?
SSR/SSR0013300
Shut up! Don't make me say it again![nl]See ya!
RAK/RAK0053940
She earnestly thanked me. That's pretty rare.
RAK/RAK0053950
I hope this helps her get to know her classmates better.
RAK/RAK0053960
Well, if she doesn't want to talk to them,[nl]it really isn't my place to say anything.
