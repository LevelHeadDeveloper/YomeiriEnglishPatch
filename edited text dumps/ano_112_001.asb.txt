Raku dearest, Raku dearest![nl]How about a game of Old Maid with me!?
RAK/RAK0062790
Old Maid? That came outta nowhere.
MRK/MRK0010900
Haven't you heard!?[nl]There's an unprecedented Old Maid craze[nl]sweeping Bonyari High!
MRK/MRK0010910
I don't know how it started, but it's at the point[nl]where anyone not carrying a deck of cards is considered[nl]'old-fashioned'.
RAK/RAK0062800
Gah, for real!?[nl]I seriously had no idea....
MRK/MRK0010920
Anyway, I have a deck of cards with me,[nl]so let's get right into a game.
CTG/CTG0014710
Hang on there, Marika. I don't know how many times[nl]I'm gonna have to say this, but stay away from my Darling.

MRK/MRK0010930
Oh, and here's the old maid now.

Who are you calling an old maid!?
SSR/SSR0019830
Marika Tachibana![nl]You are being far too rude to the Mistress!
RAK/RAK0062810
Good grief, everyone please stop fighting,[nl]for goodness sake!
MRK/MRK0010940
I don't really have any intention of fighting,[nl]but these old maids here....
CTG/CTG0014730
Ghh.... There you go again.[nl]At this point, I won't be satisfied without a sincere apology.
MRK/MRK0010950
That's exactly what I wanted to hear. It's about time we[nl]settle once and for all who's more suited to be[nl]Raku dearest's girlfriend!
SSR/SSR0019840
This seems interesting....[nl]I'll join in as a witness.
CTG/CTG0014740G
Let's play some Old Maid!
RAK/RAK0062820
H-Hey....[nl]Simmer down, guys!
SSR/SSR0019850
Why are you saying it like you're not part of this!?
CTG/CTG0014750
You're joining too, so we have enough people!
RAK/RAK0062830
Whaaat!?
