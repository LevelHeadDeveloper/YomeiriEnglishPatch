....It's this late already, huh.[nl]I was so caught up in taking care of the animals,[nl]that I left later than I expected to.
SSR/SSR0017050
You're late, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0057470
Huh? Tsugumi? What are you doing here?[nl]And what do you mean "I'm late"....?
SSR/SSR0017060
Mhm....I was actually waiting for you.
@expose
SSR/SSR0017070
Raku Ichijo. Would you like to play a game with me?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0057480
Huh....? What the hell, that's sudden.
SSR/SSR0017080
In one hour's time, a combat exercise will be[nl]conducted in the Beehive compound.[nl]You are to participate in this exercise.
RAK/RAK0057490
Huhh!? Why me!?
SSR/SSR0017090
If you really want to call yourself the Mistress's lover, you[nl]need to have some combat experience. Otherwise, you[nl]won't be able to protect her when the time comes, will you?
RAK/RAK0057500
But, like....I don't mean to brag,[nl]but I've never been in a fight.
SSR/SSR0017100
Don't go beating your chest over that, it's pathetic.
SSR/SSR0017110
Don't worry. Even though it's a combat exercise,[nl]I don't actually intend for you to fight.[nl]All you need to do is run away.
RAK/RAK0057510
I-Is that so?
SSR/SSR0017120
Yeah. Whether bullets are ricocheting or fire is raging,[nl]you just need to run away.
SSR/SSR0017130
If you cannot protect yourself, there's no way[nl]you can protect the Mistress. So that's step one.
RAK/RAK0057520
You mentioned bullets and fire just now....[nl]That kinda sounds like real combat....
SSR/SSR0017140
You've been a real chatterbox for a while now.[nl]All you need to say is "I will" or "I won't"!
SSR/SSR0017150
Or rather, do it! You must do it![nl]You know what happens if you refuse, right?
RAK/RAK0057530
N-No way! Now you're just threatening me!
SSR/SSR0017160
Just answer me. You're wasting time.
RAK/RAK0057540
Ghhh....understood.[nl]Well then--
I won't
I'll try it
RAK/RAK0057550
I don't think I'll do it.[nl]After today, I'm beat.
SSR/SSR0017170
....I see.
SSR/SSR0017180
You're gutless. I had thought you'd have[nl]at least some backbone, but....too bad.
RAK/RAK0057560
(Hmmm....I'd have thought she'd be madder....[nl] But she seems more like she's taken aback.)
RAK/RAK0057570
(But, well, I've got to spare my life.[nl] Forgive me, Tsugumi.)
@イベント終了処理
RAK/RAK0057580
I'll do it! I'll escape for sure and surprise you!
SSR/SSR0017190
Ohh....I look forward to seeing it.[nl]If you do manage to escape, I'll give you a present.
SSR/SSR0017200
Then let us begin! Follow me!
@時間経過演出
SSR/SSR0017210
This is Tsugumi.[nl]Raku Ichijo, do you read me?
RAK/RAK0057590
Yeah, loud and clear.
SSR/SSR0017220
I'm certain you're in position.[nl]So I shall begin explaining.
SSR/SSR0017240
The rules are quite simple.[nl]Avoid being noticed by the enemy and make your way[nl]to me, and you win. If you give up along the way, you lose.
SSR/SSR0017250
However, there are several members of the Beehive[nl]roaming around the mansion, looking for you.
SSR/SSR0017260
If they find you, I cannot guarantee you'll live.[nl]---That is all.
RAK/RAK0057600
Huh!? Wait![nl]That last part wasn't exactly clear![nl]What will they do when they catch me!?
SSR/SSR0017270
Try to escape so you don't find out.[nl]Let's get started.
RAK/RAK0057610
Dammit, I guess we've really gotta do this, then....[nl]I'm really going to escape!
