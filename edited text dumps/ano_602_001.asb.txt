What's wrong, Raku!?[nl]You're all sweaty again!
RAK/RAK0064100
Y-Yeah.... I managed to lose[nl]that bastard Claude again.

@ザクシャ千棘・大
CTG/CTG0015250
You went to all that trouble just to[nl]be alone with me....
RAK/RAK0064110
No, that's not why I did it.[nl]My pride as a man was on the line.
CTG/CTG0015260
....Idiot. Even if it isn't true,[nl]you could have at least *said* you did it for me.
RAK/RAK0064120
Huh?
CTG/CTG0015270
That is....even if it isn't true, we're supposed to be dating,[nl]so if you can't say things like that on a regular basis,[nl]you'll get caught one day!
RAK/RAK0064130
I see. So it's like that.
CTG/CTG0015280
So, um.... Even without Claude and the others here,[nl]why don't we put on our act like usual?
CTG/CTG0015290
With you as my boyfriend and me as your girlfriend.[nl]Let's make it seem even more real than usual.
RAK/RAK0064140
As long as you don't mind, that's fine with me.
CTG/CTG0015300
I-I see....
CTG/CTG0015310
Alright! It's settled![nl]Let's head home after grabbing some ramen.[nl]Your treat of course, boyfriend.
RAK/RAK0064150
Gah, so that's what you meant!
CTG/CTG0015320
Hehe.... You are my boyfriend, after all.[nl]One of these days, I'll treat you, too.
RAK/RAK0064160
....You can only have one bowl of seconds.
CTG/CTG0015330
Awww, you're such a bad boyfriend.

Waah, Ichijo!? You're all sweaty, are you okay!?
RAK/RAK0064170
Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]Yeah. I can handle this much.
RAK/RAK0064180
(Wait, I made it to Onodera all right....[nl] But should I ask her to walk home with me again?)
KSK/KSK0017340
Ummm.... Since we've run into each other,[nl]how about we go somewhere on the way home?
RAK/RAK0064190
Huh?
KSK/KSK0017350
You invited me last time,[nl]so today I figured....I should invite you.
@expose
KSK/KSK0017360
How about it....?
RAK/RAK0064200
S-Sure! Anywhere you wanna go, Onodera,[nl]I'll go there with you!
@ザクシャ小咲・大
KSK/KSK0017370
Hehe. We won't be going that far, though.[nl]I also think it would be nice if we talk about[nl]junior high for the first time in a while.
RAK/RAK0064210
A-Alright, then. Shall we find a place to hang out?
KSK/KSK0017380
Yeah. Let's go, Ichijo. ♪

Wha.... Raku Ichijo!?[nl]What are you doing here!?
SSR/SSR0020360
Don't tell me you managed to shake Claude again!?
RAK/RAK0064220
Hahh, hahh, hahh....[nl]That's right, Tsugumi!
@ザクシャ誠士郎・大
SSR/SSR0020370
You got Claude off your back again....[nl]I honestly can't believe it....
SSR/SSR0020380
T-Tell me how you managed to hide from him![nl]I want to use it as reference for the future!
RAK/RAK0064230
U-Umm.... I was so caught up in running away[nl]that I can't really remember what I did.
SSR/SSR0020390
Don't act so modest! I won't let you go[nl]until you tell me your secret!
RAK/RAK0064240
(I don't know how I got into this bizarre situation,[nl] but I never thought Tsugumi would praise me like this....[nl] Maybe all my hard work is paying off now!)

Are you alright, Raku dearest?[nl]You look tired again....
RAK/RAK0064250
Yeah....[nl]Today's game of hide-and-seek was especially hard.
MRK/MRK0011380
Hahh....I see.
MRK/MRK0011390
Oh, but hang on![nl]Did you come here to see me again this time?
RAK/RAK0064260
That was the plan, anyway.[nl]Do you have time to talk?
MRK/MRK0011400
Why, of course! Time with my darling Raku is top-priority![nl]No matter what plans I have to cancel to get it! ♪
RAK/RAK0064270
Uh, you don't need to go that far....
MRK/MRK0011410
No. I do not want to waste this opportunity to spend[nl]time with you. There's not a lot of chances for me[nl]to be alone with you.
MRK/MRK0011420
Let's talk lots today too, Raku dearest!

My, ohhh my....?[nl]The Ichijo family's young master. Where are you going?
RAK/RAK0064290
Dammit. Cornered again!
CLD/CLD0002150
Looks like you miiight have been trying to escape[nl]from us again.... No doubt you were[nl]thinking the usual guilty thoughts, weren't you?
CLD/CLD0002160
Seems as though the previous interrogation session[nl]wasn't enough for you. This time, I'll make sure[nl]to really take my time.
RAK/RAK0064040
