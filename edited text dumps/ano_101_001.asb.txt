Looks like my lunchbox today has steak, and crab,[nl]and spring rolls. Hehehe.... Delishoush!♪

MRK/MRK0010800
Raku dearessst! I accidentally made an extra lunchbox today![nl]Perhaps you'd like to have it?
@expose2
MRK/MRK0010810
These croquettes are super-sized, because I made them[nl]especially for you with lots of love. Here, say "ahh"! ♪
RAK/RAK0060300
You just contradicted what you said at first![nl]At least try to be consistent.
SYU/SYU0009740
Siggghhhh....[nl]I feel so empty.
RAK/RAK0060310
Huh? That came outta nowhere.
SYU/SYU0009750
For me, it's always a sandwich from the cafeteria.[nl]Curry sandwiches, yakisoba sandwiches, and cutlet[nl]sandwiches, all on a repeating rotation, every day....
SYU/SYU0009760
I don't lack physical satiety, don't get me wrong.[nl]It's more of a sense of emotional satiety....
RAK/RAK0060320
I've got no idea what "emotional satiety" means,[nl]but your diet sounds pretty unbalanced.
SYU/SYU0009770
That too, that too!
RAK/RAK0060330
Stop making such a weird noise.[nl]Jeez....
Share my lunch with him
I've got nothing to give him
RAK/RAK0060340
Here, have some.
SYU/SYU0009780
Huh....? Isn't this your lunch?
RAK/RAK0060350
I'll trade it for your sandwich, just for today.
RAK/RAK0060360
I gotta say, today's rolled omelet came out great!
SYU/SYU0009790
O-Ooooooh! Rakuuu![nl]You'd make a great wife, ya know!
SYU/SYU0009800
Or rather, please marry me!
RAK/RAK0060370
Give me back my lunch.
@expose
SYU/SYU0009810
Just kidding! ♪[nl]Thank you, Raku!
RAK/RAK0060380
Well, you've also helped me out, to an extent.
SYU/SYU0009820
Yeah, yeah. Though if I could help it,[nl]I'd have rather had a lunch made by a girl than one made[nl]by a guy!
RAK/RAK0060390
Give it back, you idiot!
SYU/SYU0009830
I was just joking! ♪[nl]Really, I'm happy with this, Raku.
SYU/SYU0009840
This isn't really a token of thanks,[nl]but you can have this, as well as my sandwich.
RAK/RAK0060400
A coupon? Where'd you get this?
SYU/SYU0009850
I've got a few *connections*.[nl]By the way, that's not just any ordinary coupon.
RAK/RAK0060410
Let's see....[nl]An ice cream coupon?
SYU/SYU0009860
Yes. That coupon is a rare item.[nl]Use it when you feel the time is right.
RAK/RAK0060420
Sorry, I don't have any food to give you.[nl]Though if you put in a bit of effort, I'm sure you could find[nl]a girl or two who'd be willing to make you lunch.
SYU/SYU0009870
Dammit, you cold bastard![nl]Easy for you to say, you've got a girlfriend!
SYU/SYU0009880
WAAAAAAAAAAH![nl]I'm gonna make sure everyone in class hears about this!
RAK/RAK0060430
Oh! Hey, Shuu!
RAK/RAK0060440
(Hmmm, maybe I went a bit far....)
