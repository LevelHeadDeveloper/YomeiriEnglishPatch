Hmmmm.....
CTG/CTG0020140
What are you grumbling about?[nl]It's kinda creepy....
RAK/RAK0071770
Well....I can't read the writing on the blackboard.[nl]Here, this part of the notebook.
CTG/CTG0020150
Huh? You can't read that?[nl]I think it was written in pretty big letters.
RAK/RAK0071780
No, no, it's really small.[nl]This teacher is famous for his small handwriting.
@expose
CTG/CTG0020160
Hmmm, really?[nl]Okay, you can borrow my notebook.
RAK/RAK0071790
Oh, thanks. Okaaay....[nl]I see. I didn't know it said this.
SYU/SYU0013590
Hey, hey, Raaaku.
RAK/RAK0071800
Hm? Whatcha need, Shuu?
SYU/SYU0013600
Whaddya think that shiny thing is?[nl]Look, there on the ground....there's something shiny[nl]by the school gate, right?
RAK/RAK0071810
Hmm, so there is....[nl]I wonder what it is.
CTG/CTG0020170
Someone dropped their key.[nl]From the look of it, it's a bicycle key.
RAK/RAK0071820
Whaa!? You can see it from this far away!?
CTG/CTG0020180
Huh? You guys can't see it?
SYU/SYU0013610
Kirisaki, how good is your eyesight?
@expose
CTG/CTG0020190
Well, I think they told me it was 20/10....
RAK/RAK0071830
20/10!?
CTG/CTG0020200
Huh? I-Is that such a surprise!?[nl]I'd heard a lot of Japanese people have bad eyesight!
RAK/RAK0071840
It's not a matter of whether or not you're Japanese![nl]20/10 eyesight is very rare for humans in general!
SYU/SYU0013620
Wowww, that's amazing.[nl]If his girlfriend has such good eyesight, there's no way[nl]Raku's gonna be able to cheat on her!
RAK/RAK0071850
....Huh?
CTG/CTG0020210
Hmmmmm. Cheating, huh....
RAK/RAK0071860
S-Shuu! Stop saying such weird things!
SYU/SYU0013630
Hahaha, sorry, sorry.
RAK/RAK0071870
Seriously....[nl]Why does he have to tease me like that?
CTG/CTG0020220
But, well....you know.
CTG/CTG0020230
We aren't real lovers, so whatever it is you did,[nl]it isn't really cheating on me or anything.
CTG/CTG0020240
....But I don't want to see any of that,[nl]no matter how good my eyesight is.
RAK/RAK0071880
....Chitoge?
CTG/CTG0020250
Well, it doesn't really matter, right?[nl]Do whatever you wanna do.
RAK/RAK0071890
What the hell. If something's bothering you, just say it.
CTG/CTG0020260
Hm?
RAK/RAK0071900
Sure, we're not really dating, but if we're gonna keep this[nl]up for three years, wouldn't it be harder if you kept your[nl]feelings of disapproval to yourself?
RAK/RAK0071910
Whatever you say, I'll take it in stride.[nl]It's not like our relationship is gonna fall apart over[nl]something like that, right?

@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0020270
What a stupid bean sprout.
RAK/RAK0071920
....Wha!? You're gonna say that!?
CTG/CTG0020280
Hehe....just kidding.
CTG/CTG0020290
I'm not gonna say it right now,[nl]but someday I might lose patience and let it out with a bang.
RAK/RAK0071930
With a bang!?[nl]No, you know, you've gotta do it in small doses....
CTG/CTG0020300
Nope.[nl]....Again, I'm not gonna say it right now.
RAK/RAK0071940
That's not how this works. We can't give each other away,[nl]and for the safety of this town,[nl]we need to pretend to be lovers.
CTG/CTG0020310
For the safety of this town....huh.[nl]Is that it?
RAK/RAK0071950
Hm? What else is there?
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0020320
No, it's nothing.
CTG/CTG0020330
....Stupid bean sprout.
