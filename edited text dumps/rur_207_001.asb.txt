Hm? Whose number is this....?
RAK/RAK0044680
Hello?
RUR/RUR0010510
It's Miyamoto....[nl]Is this Ichijo?
RAK/RAK0044690
Ah, yes! I didn't recognize the number,[nl]so I thought it might be someone else. What's up?
RUR/RUR0010520
I found your number in the school's emergency contact list.[nl]Our next music class has been changed to P.E., so make sure[nl]you're ready for that.
RAK/RAK0044700
I see. Thank you.
RAK/RAK0044710
Wait. Why is it that you're using the school's[nl]emergency contact list? Isn't it usually the other way round?
RUR/RUR0010540
By the way, me and Kosaki are[nl]heading into town this Saturday.
RAK/RAK0044720
Huh!? I-Is that so!?
RUR/RUR0010550
Alright, make sure you call up the next person[nl]and tell them what I said earlier.
RAK/RAK0044730
O-Okay....[nl]Thanks, Miyamoto.
RAK/RAK0044740
....She didn't answer my question....
RAK/RAK0044750
But I *did* get some useful information.
