Hey, hey, Darling![nl]You're free Saturday, right?
RAK/RAK0044890
I think I'm free....[nl]But why did you assume I'd be free, Honey?
CTG/CTG0013420
If you're free, that's great.[nl]We'll go out that day.
RAK/RAK0044900
Where are we going?
@expose
CTG/CTG0013430
I haven't decided yet!
RAK/RAK0044910
Then why be so bossy....?[nl]Why should I even go out with you in the first place?
CTG/CTG0013440
Because we have a scheduled date.
RAK/RAK0044920
Oh, it's that time already, huh.[nl]Is Claude still suspicious of us?
CTG/CTG0013450
Well, something like that.
CTG/CTG0013460
Alright, meet me at the station at 11 o'clock sharp![nl]Okay? You won't forget, right?
RAK/RAK0044930
Make sure you're not late, okay?
@expose2
CTG/CTG0013470
I won't be late! I'm not a child.
RAK/RAK0044940
Yeah, yeah. Being a couple is such hard work....
RUR/RUR0010630
There you have it, Kosaki.
KSK/KSK0011100
....Yeah....
RUR/RUR0010640
It's your fault for being so slow.
KSK/KSK0011110
RUR/RUR0010650
So, what are you gonna do?
