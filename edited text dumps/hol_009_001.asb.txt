Yawwwn.[nl]I think I'll just sleep all day.
RAK/RAK0065920
...Zzz, Zzz... 
OTM/OTM0007130
Hey, Raku! 
@画面揺らし2
RAK/RAK0065930
Gwah! G-Get off my stomach![nl]What the hell are you doing!?
@expose
OTM/OTM0007140
Raku! Let's go!
RAK/RAK0065940
I'm sleepy, but...
OTM/OTM0007150
Thou shalt clean the shrine today! Get ready!
@叫び揺れ
RAK/RAK0065950
Heyheyheyhey! I got it,[nl]let go of my arm!

@時間経過演出
OTM/OTM0007160
There's still some garbage over there![nl]Clean it up properly!
RAK/RAK0065960
Okay, okay![nl]Damn... This fox girl is really rough with people.
RAK/RAK0065970
I can't believe we're cleaning the shrine[nl]on a Sunday afternoon....
OTM/OTM0007170
As the grounds becometh beautiful through cleanliness,[nl]I can feel my body and soul becoming clearer.[nl]Ahh... It's so pleasant~.
RAK/RAK0065980
It's great that you're happy, but I still need to pick up all[nl]these fallen leaves, and wipe down the shrine...[nl]This is gonna take all day.
OTM/OTM0007180
Hmm? Thou needn't be so meticulous.[nl]As long as the trash gets picked up,[nl]thou canst just do the rest quickly and roughly.
RAK/RAK0065990
No, as long as I'm doing something,[nl]I'm going to do it right!
OTM/OTM0007190
As usual...
OTM/OTM0007200
Hm!? Someone approaches[nl]I shalt leave for a bit. Away...
SYU/SYU0012820
Yo, Raku![nl]Hey.... Are you here by yourself?
SYU/SYU0012830
I thought I heard you talking to someone when I was[nl]passing by, but... I guess you were talking to yourself.
SYU/SYU0012840
It's kinda scary...!
RAK/RAK0066000
I-It's okay, really![nl]Also, if you're free, I'd appreciate a hand with this.
SYU/SYU0012850
What do you need me to do?
RAK/RAK0066010
Help me clean this temple. It would take forever if[nl]I tried to do it myself.
SYU/SYU0012860
I see... If that's the case, just let me handle it.
SYU/SYU0012870
Ya~, ha~, h.....a~.[nl]Alright, sent! 
RAK/RAK0066020
Who did you just email?
SYU/SYU0012880
Hehehe... In around ten minutes,[nl]you should start calling me "Master Shuu"[nl]out of gratitude and respect.
RAK/RAK0066030
...Huh?
@ＢＧＭ再生
KSK/KSK0017520
T-Thanks for waiting, Ichijo!
KSK/KSK0017530
Maiko's email said you were going to[nl]clean up this shrine, right?[nl]I'm here to help!
RAK/RAK0066040
Thank you, Master Shuu! 
SYU/SYU0012890
Bah, ha ha ha![nl]It doesn't get any better than this!
MRK/MRK0011540
Raku dearest, thank you for your patience![nl]I'm here to help you, too!
CTG/CTG0015440
It's a lot of trouble, but if my boyfriend needs help,[nl]I have to be there.
SSR/SSR0020560
I can't have the mistress cleaning up without me.[nl]Leave it to me, Raku Ichijo!
RAK/RAK0066050
O, Oh!?[nl]Did you call everyone? 
SYU/SYU0012900
It's more fun to clean when all these cute girls[nl]are helping you! I'm the man!
RAK/RAK0066060
Yeah, I guess you are the man...
RUR/RUR0012550
Looks like I got here last.
RAK/RAK0066070
Oh, you're here too, Miyamoto!?
RUR/RUR0012560
Yes. I'm here for the tasty baked- I mean,[nl]I'm here to help my classmates.
RAK/RAK0066080
Baked... What?
RUR/RUR0012570
Right, let's get to cleaning.[nl]I'll thoroughly clean up these fallen leaves.
KSK/KSK0017540
Ruri... Is that a sweet potato that just fell out of your bag?
RAK/RAK0066090
You're here for baked sweet potatoes, Miyamoto...
CTG/CTG0015450
Alright, let's finish up cleaning and then we can[nl]have a sweet potato party!
KSK/KSK0017550
Oh!♪
OTM/OTM0007210
Hm. Raku, thou doth have a lot of good friends.
OTM/OTM0007220
...The shrine is livelier now than it ever has been[nl]since I started living here.
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0066100
Phew... I think we're done.[nl]Now, as for these leaves...
RUR/RUR0012580
No good. We don't have enough.
RAK/RAK0066110
Huh, what?
RUR/RUR0012590
We don't have enough leaves to bake enough[nl]sweet potatoes for the number of people here.
RAK/RAK0066120
I mean... It looks like we've got at least[nl]20 sweet potatoes as it is. Is that not enough?
CTG/CTG0015460
If we don't have enough leaves,[nl]why not grab some from the trees?
KSK/KSK0017560
We shouldn't do that, Chitoge.[nl]Wouldn't it be better to leave the healthy leaves alone?
MRK/MRK0011550
But then we can't have our baked potato party.
SSR/SSR0020570
Raku Ichijo... do you have any suggestions?
RAK/RAK0066130
Well, let me think...
OTM/OTM0007230
(Good grief, I guess I have to...) 
RAK/RAK0066140
(Huh...was that Otama speaking just now!?)
OTM/OTM0007240
(Thanks for cleaning up.... Enjoy thyselves!)
CTG/CTG0015470G
Kyaa!!
SSR/SSR0020580
It-It's so windy now!
MRK/MRK0011560
Well! Look at all the leaves that just fell!
RUR/RUR0012600
Looks like we have enough now!
RAK/RAK0066150
Otama....
SYU/SYU0012910
Alright, Raku![nl]Let's all gather around for a baked potato party!
RAK/RAK0066160
Oh, okay! 
@背景変更
CTG/CTG0015480
Yum!★ It's so fluffy and delicious~!
RUR/RUR0012610
Nom nom nom.... I could eat these all day.
SYU/SYU0012920
Ah, um, Ruri!? That one was mine... .
SSR/SSR0020590
It's amazing. It just came off the fire, but it's so[nl]sweet and delicious.
KSK/KSK0017580
Won't they get mad at us[nl]for having a fire without an adult?
MRK/MRK0011570
Don't worry about that.[nl]Honda's keeping an eye on us. 
CTG/CTG0015490
I think Claude might be around here as well.[nl]In a way, we are accompanied by an adult.
KSK/KSK0017590
Ahaha... That's a relief..
........ 
@フェードアウト
RAK/RAK0066170
Here, I have one for you.
RAK/RAK0066180
You're the one who made our party possible.[nl]Eat well... Otama.
OTM/OTM0007250
Thy tone makes it sound like thou art dead.[nl]Hardly a good sign....
OTM/OTM0007260
Nom...
OTM/OTM0007270
Mmm. It's almost as good as fried tofu!
