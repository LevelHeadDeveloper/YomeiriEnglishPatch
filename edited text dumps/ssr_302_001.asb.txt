Sorry, Raku. I know you were meant to have a date today,[nl]but my daughter has overslept....
RAK/RAK0058880
Well, it's hardly a real date as real lovers.[nl]I can see why she wouldn't be into it.
CTP/CTP0000340
I'm sorry about all the trouble....[nl]But you've been very helpful to me.[nl]Thank you.
CTP/CTP0000350
Chitoge seems in a rush to get ready right now,[nl]so you'll have to wait a while.
CTP/CTP0000360
You can have a look around if you like.[nl]The rooms you're not supposed to enter will be locked.
RAK/RAK0058890
Okay. Thank you very much.
RAK/RAK0058900
(Well, I guess I'll take him up on that and[nl] take a walk around.)

Every time I come in it hits me how big this place really is.[nl]I gotta be careful to not get lost.

RAK/RAK0058920
....I said before getting lost.
RAK/RAK0058930
What the hell is this room?[nl]It's so blatantly suspicious....
RAK/RAK0058940
Why are there handcuffs hanging from that chair?
RAK/RAK0058950
And why is there a picture of me on the wall?[nl]And there's knives all over it....
RAK/RAK0058960
There's all kinds of tools on the floor,[nl]and I don't know what they're used for....
RAK/RAK0058970
I get the feeling I'm not supposed to be here....
SSR/SSR0018490
That's correct, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0058980
Huh? Tsugu--

SSR/SSR0018500
Hmph!

RAK/RAK0058990
Gaah!?
SSR/SSR0018510
Raku Ichijo has been secured.[nl]....Yes, I've stunned him for the time being.
SSR/SSR0018520
....Yes. I'm going to carry him out.
RAK/RAK0059000
....!?
RAK/RAK0059010
H-Huh....?[nl]Is this....my room?
RAK/RAK0059020
I thought I was at Chitoge's house just now....
SSR/SSR0018530
You're awake, Raku Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0059030
Tsugumi!?
SSR/SSR0018540
I was surprised to find you passed out in the hallway.
RAK/RAK0059040
Passed out in the hallway? Me....?
SSR/SSR0018550
When I found you, I carried you all the way[nl]back to your house. You should be grateful.
SSR/SSR0018560
The Mistress was terribly worried. You don't have a fever,[nl]and you were probably just exhausted,[nl]but you should take better care of yourself.
RAK/RAK0059050
N-No....[nl]I remember you knocked me out....in the basement.
SSR/SSR0018570
Basement? What are you talking about?
SSR/SSR0018580
You're exhausted. You need to take better care of yourself.
RAK/RAK0059060
Huh....?[nl]No, no, but the basement....
SSR/SSR0018590
Raku Ichijo, you are exhausted.
SSR/SSR0018600
....Okay?
RAK/RAK0059070
O-Okay.....sorry.
RAK/RAK0059080
(T-That smile's creeping me out!)
RAK/RAK0059090
(What the hell was that room!?[nl] Well, I'm too scared to ask, but....)
SSR/SSR0018610
See ya, Raku Ichijo. Live long, okay?
