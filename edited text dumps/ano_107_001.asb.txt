What's up? You seem to be in a good mood.
SYU/SYU0011020
All the hard work I've been doing is paying off.[nl]I think I'm about to get a lot more connections.
RAK/RAK0061260
Ooh.... Your networking skills really are amazing.[nl]We even ended up relying on that network you've got[nl]for the school festival.
@expose
SYU/SYU0011030
Well, duh. ♪ I intend to use these connections[nl]to do something somewhere down the line,[nl]and it can't hurt to start preparing now, right?
RAK/RAK0061270
Down the line....[nl]I'm not sure what you mean by that.
SYU/SYU0011040
You never know when your life will[nl]reach a turning point, right? You might even end up[nl]suddenly getting married to someone.
@ano_107_kosaki
SYU/SYU0011050
Maybe you still want to marry Onodera?
RAK/RAK0061280
Y-You idiot! Don't say her name out loud!
SYU/SYU0011060
The wedding of Onodera and Raku.[nl]Hehe.... Just the thought of it makes me laugh.
RAK/RAK0061290
I'm gonna punch you....
SYU/SYU0011070
No, no, that would be a happy future.[nl]And if I gave the wedding speech, I'm sure it'd be a hit.
RAK/RAK0061301
Why would you be doing it!?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0011080
Come on, come on. ♪[nl]I'd make it the best of the best!
SYU/SYU0011090
After all, I don't think there's anyone else[nl]who watches you two like I do.
RAK/RAK0061310
Ghh....[nl]Well, you might be right.
RAK/RAK0061320
But I couldn't ask you to do that....
SYU/SYU0011100
Hey, instead of worrying about that, maybe worry about[nl]whether you could get Onodera to marry you.[nl]....Could you do that?
RAK/RAK0061330
S-Shaddup![nl]I'm gonna give it my all from here on out, just watch!
SYU/SYU0011110
If you don't, I might just be waiting[nl]until we're both old.... I'm gonna live so long.♪
RAK/RAK0061340
W-Why you little....![nl]Just you wait and see....

You and Onodera seem to be a lot more friendly these days.

....But I can't say that seems likely to happen.[nl]Right now, we should keep being friends, right?
RAK/RAK0061390
