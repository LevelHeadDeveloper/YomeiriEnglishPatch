Good morning, Raku dearest.
RAK/RAK0081610
Oh, good morning.
MRK/MRK0018530
I know it's a bit sudden, but would you[nl]like to take a brief psychological test?
RAK/RAK0081620
....That really is sudden.[nl]Well, alright.
@expose
MRK/MRK0018540
Thank you. Okay then....
MRK/MRK0018550
You are standing in front of a white house on a hill.[nl]The white house has large windows, and through them you[nl]can see a happy couple and two children.
MRK/MRK0018560
Now, what color curtains do you see on the windows?
RAK/RAK0081630
....What would my answer tell you about me?
MRK/MRK0018570
Just answer what your intuition tells you, please.
RAK/RAK0081640
Hmmm. Curtains, curtains....[nl]You said the house was white? Considering that....
RAK/RAK0081650
A light green....maybe?
MRK/MRK0018580
I see, I see.
MRK/MRK0018590
Got it. I'll use this as a reference!
RAK/RAK0081660
Huh? O-Okay.[nl]....Wait, what are my results, then?
MRK/MRK0018600
Huh?
RAK/RAK0081670
You said this was a psychological test.
MRK/MRK0018610
R-Riiight![nl]S-So it was. Let's seeee.....
MRK/MRK0018620
That's a secret. ♪
RAK/RAK0081680
