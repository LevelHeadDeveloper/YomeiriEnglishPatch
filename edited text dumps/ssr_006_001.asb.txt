Raku Ichijo....
SSR/SSR0006990
I can't stop thinking about him....
SSR/SSR0007000
....I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk,[nl]but now I'm even wider awake.
@expose
.....
SSR/SSR0007010
I haven't been to a shrine or[nl]temple since the summer festival.
SSR/SSR0007020
From what I've heard, these places usually[nl]have a god of marriage or something....
SSR/SSR0007030
Marriage, huh....
SSR/SSR0007040
He is the mistress's boyfriend.[nl]I cannot tell him how I feel.
SSR/SSR0007050
....But if I can't tell him how I feel,[nl]I can at least---
SSR/SSR0007060
I wish I could be with Raku Ichijo all the time,[nl]like the mistress is....
SSR/SSR0007070
I want to be closer to him than anyone else....
SSR/SSR0007080
....Haha. What a stupid thing for me to say.
SSR/SSR0007090
I'm Seishiro Tsugumi of the Beehive.[nl]The agent entrusted with guarding the mistress....
SSR/SSR0007100
I can only push away those feelings that get in the way.[nl]It has always been and will always be this way,[nl]as it should be.
SSR/SSR0007110
....Well then, I'm headed home.
OTM/OTM0001100
Thy wish shall be granted----.

RAK/RAK0018720
(Mgh, it's morning already.[nl] It was awfully hard to sleep.)
RAK/RAK0018730
(My shoulders ache like hell,[nl] as though my chest were heavy....)
RAK/RAK0018740
(Well, whatever. I'm going to go wash my face....)
@ＢＧＭ再生
SSR/SSR0007120
Oh, Ryuu. Good morning.[nl]You're up early this morning.
RYU/RYU0000290
Ah, young master! G'morni---
RYU/RYU0000300
WHAAAAAAAAAA!?
SSR/SSR0007130
W-What the hell!?[nl]That's too loud for so early in the morning.
RYU/RYU0000310
----
SSR/SSR0007140
H-Hey, Ryuu! Why are you so quiet all of a sudden? Hey!
RYU/RYU0000320
....Woah! I'm so proud of you, young master![nl]When I wasn't lookin', he skipped this many steps[nl]on the stairs to adulthood and jumped right to the top!
SSR/SSR0007150
Huh!?
RYU/RYU0000330
Oi, all of you![nl]Go buy some azuki beans and rice cakes right now!
RYU/RYU0000340
We're havin' sekihan this mornin', sekihan![nl]Get the very best o' the best!
SSR/SSR0007160
W-What the hell have you been talking about?
RYU/RYU0000350
Yes~, I thought the young master was still a boy,[nl]but he is now truly a man!
RYU/RYU0000360
I'm feelin' happy an' sad at the same time!
SSR/SSR0007170
Listen to me!
RYU/RYU0000370
Um, Tsugumi, was it?[nl]As the young master's lover, take good care of him, alright?
SSR/SSR0007180
Huh!? T-Tsugumi!?[nl]Is Tsugumi here?
RYU/RYU0000380
Is she....young mistress,[nl]your name is "Seishiro Tsugumi", right?
SSR/SSR0007190
Huh!? I don't know what you're talking abou---
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0018750
(Hang on a sec.[nl] My voice sounds a little weird, doesn't it?[nl] It sounds strangely high....)
SSR/SSR0007200
Aa, aa......
SSR/SSR0007210
This chest....no way....
RAK/RAK0018760
(No no no no no![nl] That's ridiculous!)
RYU/RYU0000390
Hey, where are ya goin', young mistress?[nl]If yer lookin' for the bathroom, it's the other way!
SSR/SSR0007220
To the washroom, the washroom!
SSR/SSR0007230
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!?
SSR/SSR0007240
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-
SSR/SSR0007250
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!?!?
RAK/RAK0018770
(Why is Tsugumi in my house!?[nl] No, wait, why am I Tsugumi!?)
RAK/RAK0018780
(I was definitely me when I went to bed! [nl]No, wait, I'm not even sure it was me when I went to bed!)
RAK/RAK0018790
(Anyway, calm down, calm down![nl] First of all, let's try to stay calm. Okay, me?)
RAK/RAK0018800
(This is probably just a dream. I'm still asleep!)
RAK/RAK0018810
(Jeez, I can't even get up on time![nl] I'd better wake up now, or it'll be noon!)
RAK/RAK0018820
(So, if I close my eyes like this....)
RAK/RAK0018830
(Alright.)
SSR/SSR0007260
I'm still Tsugumi!!
SSR/SSR0007270
Besides, the reason I had trouble sleeping....[nl]must have been these big things.
SSR/SSR0007280
These....big....
@画面揺らし2
SSR/SSR0007290
HEEEEY! What the hell am I thinking!?[nl]This isn't the time!
RYU/RYU0000400
Hey, young mistress. The young master's not in his room,[nl]have you seen where he went?
SSR/SSR0007300
Right! Where am I?
RYU/RYU0000410
What're ya sayin', young mistress?[nl]You're right here, aren't ya?
SSR/SSR0007310
Yes, right, not me![nl]Where is Raku Ichijo!?
RYU/RYU0000420
Well, that's what I was askin' ya.[nl]Weren't ya with him all night long?
RYU/RYU0000430
Ah, no! I won't ask you for the details![nl]Yeah, just skip to the end!
SSR/SSR0007320
Aagh, it's so complicated![nl]Anyway, I need to go find my body!
SSR/SSR0007330
Wait up, me!
@pan
RYU/RYU0000440
Hang on, young mistress![nl]You're not goin' outside dressed like that, I hope!
SSR/SSR0007340
Ah! R-Right. It would be a bad idea[nl]to go out in my pajamas.
SSR/SSR0007350
So I'll need to change----
SSR/SSR0007360
......
SSR/SSR0007370
....How do I get changed?
@時間経過演出
SSR/SSR0007380
Hahh, hahh, hahh.....
RAK/RAK0018840
(Crap! I had to change with my eyes covered[nl] and that ate up a lot of time.)
RAK/RAK0018850
(If I have Tsugumi's body, then that means[nl] something might have happened to her, too!)
RAK/RAK0018860
(I'll have to go meet up with her to find out!)
CTG/CTG0008820
Ah, you're finally here. You're late, Tsugumi!
SSR/SSR0007390
Gack...!
KSK/KSK0007230
It's unusual for you to be late.[nl]Did you oversleep?
RUR/RUR0000920
Huh? But, you came from a weird direction.[nl]Isn't Ichijo's house the only one that way?
RAK/RAK0018870
(Ghh....this isn't good.[nl] Why is everyone meeting up this morning!?)
RAK/RAK0018880
(They wouldn't believe me if I told them[nl] I was Raku this way....)
RAK/RAK0018890
(I'll have to pretend to be Tsugumi here....)
SSR/SSR0007400
You're thinking too hard about this, Miss Miyamoto.[nl]I was simply going for a run around town.
CTG/CTG0008830
A run, even though we promised to meet today?
SSR/SSR0007410
Ah-...I'm sorry.[nl]Did we make a promise to meet today?
CTG/CTG0008840
What are you talking about?[nl]We all promised to help Ruri with her club activities[nl]today, didn't we?
RUR/RUR0000930
You were supposed to accompany me[nl]to my morning practice....
SSR/SSR0007420
I-Is that right? I'd completely forgotten about that.[nl]Hahaha, sorry about that.
CTG/CTG0008850
Come on, get it together.
CTG/CTG0008860
Well then, now that Tsugumi's here,[nl]let's get going, shall we?
KSK/KSK0007240
Yeah. It takes time to change clothes, and if we don't hurry,[nl]we might not make it in time for that.
SSR/SSR0007430
C-Change clothes!?
RAK/RAK0018900
(T-That's right! Miyamoto's club is the swim team![nl] That means....)
@叫び揺れ
SSR/SSR0007440
Aaaaiiieeee~~~!?!?[nl]I-I'll need to wear a swimsuit!!
@expose2
KSK/KSK0007250
Waaaa!??
CTG/CTG0008870
Ha....Why'd you yell so suddenly?
RAK/RAK0018910
(T-This isn't good! After all, I'll have to[nl] change in the girl's locker room with all of them....)
RAK/RAK0018920
(No no no! Absolutely not![nl] If that happens, I'll....)
@ＨＰ－５
SSR/SSR0007450
Plbth!
KSK/KSK0007260
Waah!? Tsugumi, you've got a nosebleed!
SSR/SSR0007460
S-Sorry! It's nothing!
RAK/RAK0018930
(Oh, no! I thought of something weird just now![nl] I'm an idiot! Die, Raku Ichijo!)
RAK/RAK0018940
(Anyway, I need to figure out how to get out of this![nl] What to do? What should I do!?)
KSK/KSK0007270
Huh? Speaking of which, where's your bag, Tsugumi?[nl]It doesn't look like you've got a change of clothes....
RAK/RAK0018950
(That's it!)
SSR/SSR0007470
S-Sorry. It looks like I forgot my bag and my swimsuit.
SSR/SSR0007480
So, I'll have to go back home and get them.[nl]Well, I'll see you---
CTG/CTG0008880
Ahh, you don't need to worry.
CTG/CTG0008890
You were planning on wearing a plain swimsuit, right?[nl]Well, I thought ahead and brought you a special stylish swimsuit!
SSR/SSR0007490
Eehh....!?
RUR/RUR0000940
The swim club has anything else you might need,[nl]so there's no problem if you show up without your stuff.
RAK/RAK0018960
(Ghh! Why the hell is Chitoge so prepared....!)
SSR/SSR0007500
Well, I'm not sure I'm in good shape for swimming today....
KSK/KSK0007280
Huh? Tsugumi, you were running pretty fast when you[nl]got here. And you also mentioned you were taking a run....
SSR/SSR0007510
Grmthk! Well, you see, that's....
CTG/CTG0008900
Come on, this is unlike you, Tsugumi![nl]Stop waffling and let's go!
SSR/SSR0007520
Waaagh! Don't pull so hard!
RAK/RAK0018970
(Dammit~! Gimme a break!)
RAK/RAK0018980
Mistress~~~!
RAK/RAK0018990
(Oh! It's me![nl] I'm finally here!
RAK/RAK0019000
Mistress, get away from that person!
CTG/CTG0008910
Huh!? What's the matter, darling?
CTG/CTG0008920
And what do you mean by "Mistress"?[nl]That's kinda creepy.
RAK/RAK0019010
Gwahh.....[nl]C-Creepy?
RAK/RAK0019020
The mistress said I was creepy....
RAK/RAK0019030
(There's no mistaking that apologetic tone.[nl] That's Tsugumi in my body, all right....)
KSK/KSK0007290
Um....Ichijo, are you okay?
RAK/RAK0019040
Huh!? Right![nl]I'm Raku Ichijo right now....
RAK/RAK0019050
C-Chito....Chitoge![nl]I'm going to borrow Tsugumi for a bit!
SSR/SSR0007530
Whaa!?
CTG/CTG0008930
Darling! Hang on, where are you taking Tsugumi!?
RAK/RAK0019060
I'll tell you everything later! Let's run!
SSR/SSR0007540
Okay!
KSK/KSK0007300
I-Ichijo!?
CTG/CTG0008940
Why is darling taking Tsugumi away?
RUR/RUR0000950
Something's fishy....
SSR/SSR0007550
What's going on, Tsugumi!? Why have we switched bodies!?
RAK/RAK0019070
Hell if I know! That's why I was looking for you!
SSR/SSR0007560
A-Anyway, we have to find somewhere where it's safe[nl]to stop and plan our next move.
@expw
RAK/RAK0019080
While I agree with that sentiment,[nl]we have one small problem.
SSR/SSR0007570
Problem?
RAK/RAK0019090
Mhm....namely, we need to shake our pursuer.
@ＢＧＭ再生
CLD/CLD0000690
I won't let you get away with this, brat!

@exposew
SSR/SSR0007590
Huh!? What the hell is going on!?
CLD/CLD0000710
This punk took advantage of our absence[nl]to sneak into your room!
CLD/CLD0000720
I don't know what this theiving dog is up to,[nl]but we'll make him talk with our[nl]"Beehive-Style Hellish Torture Techniques"!
RAK/RAK0019100
Sorry....Claude came into my room[nl]at a bad time....
SSR/SSR0007600
That's just the worst....
CLD/CLD0000730
What are you doing, Seishiro!?[nl]Hurry up and apprehend that little bastard!
SSR/SSR0007610
Ghh....[nl]There's no way we can talk things through like this....
SSR/SSR0007620
We'll have to run for now!
RAK/RAK0019110
Y-Yeah!
CLD/CLD0000740
Whaa!? What is this, Seishiro!?[nl]Why are you running away with that horrid brat!?
CLD/CLD0000750
Gah! A-Anyway, you're not getting away!
SSR/SSR0007630
Alright....do you think we shook Claude?
RAK/RAK0019120
Yeah....but he'll catch up soon if we don't keep moving.[nl]First, we need a place to hide---
MRK/MRK0000480
Raku dearest![nl]Good morning!
SSR/SSR0007640
Gwahh....Tachibana![nl]What perfect timing!
MRK/MRK0000490
Oh my, I see you're not with Kirisaki today. ♪
MRK/MRK0000500
Then, why are you with Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0007650
Well, there's a good reason, I promise....
MRK/MRK0000510
Aha....! Maybe, Raku dearest....you got tired of[nl]Kirisaki and wanted to switch to another woman....?
MRK/MRK0000520
If that's the case, then please let it be me!
RAK/RAK0019130
Hey! What the hell are you doing!?[nl]Don't grab me all of a sudden!
MRK/MRK0000530
Ohh! Raku dearest, you seem a lot wilder[nl]and more masculine today.
MRK/MRK0000540
I think it's wonderful! ★[nl]I'm falling more and more in love with you!
RAK/RAK0019140
....Ngh, this is annoying![nl]Isn't there anything you can do about this?
SSR/SSR0007660
I can't do anything about Tachibana.[nl]Now you know that, too.
RAK/RAK0019150
Oogh, you've got it rough....
CLD/CLD0000760
Found you, punk!
SSR/SSR0007670
Gaahh!? He's caught up already!
CLD/CLD0000770
Mgh!? Rrrrgh, youuuuu!!
CLD/CLD0000780
Even though you have the mistress,[nl]you have other women under your thrall....![nl]Torture alone is no longer enough!
CLD/CLD0000790
Calling all members of the Beehive![nl]Do not let this punk escape! [nl]This is a matter of life and death!
SSR/SSR0007680
H-Hey....[nl]This is beginning to snowball.
RAK/RAK0019160
We'll just have to keep running and running and running!
SSR/SSR0007690
Right!

SSR/SSR0007700
We're hiding in plain sight, I guess.[nl]They probably haven't even thought to check my room.
SSR/SSR0007710
And Ryuu's out right now,[nl]so we can probably hide here for a while.
RAK/RAK0019180
....M-Mhm.
SSR/SSR0007720
How come you're mumbling?
RAK/RAK0019190
U-Um....well, it's just that[nl]this is the first time we've been alone in your room.
SSR/SSR0007730
I-Idiot! Stop thinking such weird things!
SSR/SSR0007740
I mean, stop making such weird faces with my face![nl]It's incredibly unnerving!
RAK/RAK0019200
S-Shut up! Your face is unnerving to begin with!
SSR/SSR0007750
Glbth....it's kind of upsetting to see myself saying that.
RAK/RAK0019210
You haven't done anything weird with my body, right?
SSR/SSR0007760
Weird?
RAK/RAK0019220
Yes. Like....touching it, or looking at it----
RAK/RAK0019230
......![nl]How did you even get dressed in the first place?
RAK/RAK0019240
D-Don't tell me you saw my whole body!?
SSR/SSR0007770
I didn't see anything![nl]I did everything blindfolded!
RAK/RAK0019250
Ngh....I'll take your word for it.[nl]But if I find out you lied, you're losing your life.
RAK/RAK0019260
(....I don't think I should mention that[nl] I accidentally touched her because I[nl] was blindfolded.)
RAK/RAK0019270
Hahh....how did we get into this mess?

Wait, hang on a sec! Otama![nl]Did you do this!?
OTM/OTM0001120
Of course I did.[nl]What dost thou think, isn't it amazing?
RAK/RAK0019290
Hey, Raku Ichijo.[nl]Who is this girl?
RAK/RAK0019300
I mean....until a second ago,[nl]we were the only ones in here, right?
SSR/SSR0007810
Uhh...I promise there's a good reason for this....
RAK/RAK0019310
What are these ears? And these two tails....[nl]Are these fake?

Ghh....!

Hoho~, excellent craftsmanship.

I-I say! Touch not my sacred tail!

Whoa, it moved!
RAK/RAK0019340
I-It feels so nice and bushy, Raku Ichijo![nl]Ah, and the ears are soft, too!
OTM/OTM0001140
Heeey! That tickles![nl]Touch not mine ears without my permission!
OTM/OTM0001150
Rrrgh.....what a horrid girl, to be so presumptuous[nl]as to attempt to stroke me, a fox goddess.
RAK/RAK0019350
Fox goddess?
SSR/SSR0007830
Uh....well, to put it simply, she's a youkai.
RAK/RAK0019360
Youkai? That's absurd....[nl]You're pulling my leg, aren't you....
SSR/SSR0007840
I know you don't believe me. But the fact that she showed[nl]up out of nowhere proves it's true.
RAK/RAK0019370
What nonsense....
RAK/RAK0019380
....is what I would say, but I don't[nl]think, under the circumstances, that you're lying to me....
RAK/RAK0019390
Then, it's true....
OTM/OTM0001160
If thou understandeth, then let me go![nl]I'll haunt thee, I'll curse thee!

Hey, Tsugumi. Sorry to interrupt,[nl]but this isn't the time to play.
RAK/RAK0019420
....Huh!?
RAK/RAK0019430
Ahem....y-yes, that's true.
OTM/OTM0001180
Grrrr....I shan't forget this. My anger won't be quelled until[nl]thou giveth me at least three pieces of inari sushi!
SSR/SSR0007860
Right, right, I'll make you the usual later.
SSR/SSR0007870
More importantly, was it you who switched our bodies?
RAK/RAK0019440
Y-Yeah! Did you do that!?
OTM/OTM0001190
With my power, it wasn't a big deal.
RAK/RAK0019450
But why did you....
OTM/OTM0001200
Hm? I was merely granting thy wish.
RAK/RAK0019460
Huh....m-my wish?
OTM/OTM0001210
Mhm! Last night, thou madest a wish at my shrine,[nl]didst thou not?
RAK/RAK0019470
A wish....? I....?
RAK/RAK0019480
Ah! You must mean---
SSR/SSR0007060
I wish I could be with Raku Ichijo all the time,[nl]like the mistress is....
SSR/SSR0007070
I want to be closer to him than anyone else....
RAK/RAK0019490
You're talking about THAT!?
OTM/OTM0001220
What, that was only part of my training to become[nl]a splendid fox goddess. No need to thank me.
RAK/RAK0019500
N-No, wait! This isn't what I meant at all!
SSR/SSR0007880
Tsugumi....what exactly did you wish for?
RAK/RAK0019510
Well....I, actually, with you....
SSR/SSR0007890
With me?
RAK/RAK0019520
W-Well....
......
SSR/SSR0007900
Hey, lemme get this straight.
SSR/SSR0007910
Until we can fix this, you're saying we'll[nl]have to stay together the whole time, right?
RAK/RAK0019530
Together the whole time!?[nl]Why should I have to spend any time together with you!?
SSR/SSR0007920
Well, it's not like we can tell the others[nl]about our situation.
SSR/SSR0007930
So that means we'll need to stick together[nl]and keep tabs on each other, right?
RAK/RAK0019540
....Y-Yeah. I guess we'll be together all the time.
RAK/RAK0019550
So that's what this is about....
OTM/OTM0001230
Yes, that's what this is about! [nl]Isn't this what thou wished for?
RAK/RAK0019560
Not at allll!
RAK/RAK0019570
Ooogh....I can't believe my careless words[nl]caused this to happen....
SSR/SSR0007940
Hey! Don't just leave me out of this,[nl]tell me what's going on!
RAK/RAK0019580
I-I can't tell you!
SSR/SSR0007950
Huh!? But this was because of your wish, right?[nl]So we should work together to figure this out....
RAK/RAK0019590
....It's embarassing.
SSR/SSR0007960
Huh? Embarrassing?
SSR/SSR0007970
What's embarassing that has to do with me?
RAK/RAK0019600
L-Like I said....I can't tell you thaaaaat!
SSR/SSR0007980
H-Hey, Tsugumi! Don't go outside now![nl]Claude and the others will catch you!
RAK/RAK0019610
Shut up! Just leave me alone!
SSR/SSR0007990
My bodyyyyy!
OTM/OTM0001240
Ha ha ha....such delightful people.
SSR/SSR0008000
This is no time to laugh![nl]What did she wish for, anyway?
OTM/OTM0001250
I cannot tell thee.[nl]It's what's called a "trade secret". Trade secret!
SSR/SSR0008010
You were just looking for an excuse to use that word....
OTM/OTM0001260
Mwehehe. Cool, is it not?
OTM/OTM0001270
But, I truly cannot tell thee.[nl]It is against the rules to divulge others' wishes.
SSR/SSR0008020
Then can I ask if there's a way to reverse it?
OTM/OTM0001280
It's not impossible. If the girl wishes,[nl]from the bottom of her heart, that things go back to[nl]the way they were, it will be reversed.
SSR/SSR0008030
I see....[nl]Then I guess I'll have to go find her[nl]and find out what her wish was.
OTM/OTM0001290
Mhm....hang on, Raku.
SSR/SSR0008040
Hm?
OTM/OTM0001300
Because thou art the provider of my inari sushi,[nl]I shall let thee in on a little secret.[nl]It's a big privilege, mmkay?
OTM/OTM0001310
The girl is worried about thee.
SSR/SSR0008050
So it does have to do with me?
OTM/OTM0001320
Mhm. She's seriously worried in her own way.
SSR/SSR0008060
So then, what do I do?
OTM/OTM0001330
It's simple. There's only one thing thou canst do.
OTM/OTM0001340
You need to listen to her.
SSR/SSR0008070
-----
SSR/SSR0008080
Understood. I'll do that.
SSR/SSR0008090
You said something smart there for a change, Otama.
OTM/OTM0001350
Good, good![nl]I'd simply remembered what my grandma would say[nl]in situations like this.
OTM/OTM0001360
I know not what it means,[nl]but it sounds like something a goddess[nl]would say, does it not?
SSR/SSR0008100
You didn't even know what it meant, but you still said it.
OTM/OTM0001370
Nyehehehe....!
OTM/OTM0001380
More importantly, shouldn't thou be chasing that girl?
SSR/SSR0008110
Oh....yeah.
SSR/SSR0008120
It's too risky to have Tsugumi out and about in my body[nl]right now, so I'm going to go after her.
RAK/RAK0019620
(I don't know what's bothering Tsugumi,[nl] but if it's my fault after all....)
RAK/RAK0019630
(Then I need to be the one to resolve it!)
SSR/SSR0008130
Wait up, Tsugumi!
@時間経過演出2
CLD/CLD0000810
Hey, where the hell are you!?[nl]I will find you and kill you!
RAK/RAK0019640
(We're completely surrounded....[nl] Even Tsugumi can't get out of the city like this.)
RAK/RAK0019650
(Of course, she probably didn't go back to the[nl]Kirisaki's house, and she wouldn't go to school,[nl]where everyone knows us....)
RAK/RAK0019660
(So....then where would she go?)
RAK/RAK0019670
(....I just realized I don't[nl] know anything about Tsugumi.)
RAK/RAK0019680
(I never realized she was suffering because of me....[nl] I'm sure this is my fault.)
RAK/RAK0019690
(And that's why I need to find her!)
CTG/CTG0008950
Come on....where could Tsugumi have gone?
RAK/RAK0019700
(...! Oh no, I need to hide!)
KSK/KSK0007310
Chitoge, do you have any idea where Tsugumi[nl]might have gone?
CTG/CTG0008960
Um....now that you mention it,[nl]surprisingly, I don't know.
CTG/CTG0008970
She's not the type to go hang out by herself,[nl]so she probably knows the places she went[nl]with me or Raku....
RAK/RAK0019710
(The places she went with us, huh....)
RAK/RAK0019720
(That narrows down the search list.)
RAK/RAK0019730
Hahh.....
RAK/RAK0019740
What the hell am I doing?
RAK/RAK0019750
I know I'll get Raku Ichijo and the mistress in trouble[nl]if I don't do something....
SSR/SSR0008140
Tsugumi!
RAK/RAK0019760
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0008150
---Finally found you.
RAK/RAK0019770
Raku Ichijo....[nl]How did you know I was here?
SSR/SSR0008160
I searched everywhere I've been with you.[nl]Other than school and your house, that left the aquarium,[nl]the crepe shop, the shopping district, and here.
SSR/SSR0008170
It was hard to find you while avoiding everyone else.
RAK/RAK0019780
H-Hmph! Is this weak, frail body really that important to you?
SSR/SSR0008180
That's not it. I'm worried about you.
RAK/RAK0019790
W-What....?
SSR/SSR0008190
Tell me what's on your mind.
SSR/SSR0008200
Right now, I'm the only one who[nl]can listen to your problems.
RAK/RAK0019800
----Ghh. It's not something I can talk about so easily.
SSR/SSR0008210
Then I'll wait until you tell me.
RAK/RAK0019810
----
RAK/RAK0019820
(It's up to me to get her to talk.)
RAK/RAK0019830
(This conversation feels like an important turning point,[nl] so let's think carefully....)
