Alright, that's all for today!
KYK/KYK0000200
We're almost to the second half of the year.[nl]There's no rush, but you all might want to start[nl]thinking about your plans for the future.
KYK/KYK0000210
Okay, homeroom's done!

Hey, so about what the teacher was saying earlier....[nl]Ichijo, do you have any dreams for the future?[nl]Y'know, like "I'd like to live like this".
RAK/RAK0043640
Let's see. I don't think I have a "dream" per se,[nl]it's more of a vague goal.
SYU/SYU0007770
You wanna be a civil servant, right?
RAK/RAK0043650
Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure yet.[nl]I do know I want a stable job, though.
KSK/KSK0010760
I see. Hehehe, that's just like you, Ichijo.
SYU/SYU0007780
Hey, hey. You got any dreams for the future, Ruri?[nl]To be honest, I'm having trouble seeing that.
RAK/RAK0043660
Well, since it's Miyamoto, she's probably[nl]aiming a lot higher than you think.

....Well, I dunno.[nl]I can't say my dreams are anything special.
KSK/KSK0010770
I don't have any particularly great dreams myself.
RUR/RUR0009860
Well....it's not that I'm putting myself down,[nl]it's more that all my dreams are stupid.
RUR/RUR0009870
For example....I want to sink my teeth into a whole cake.[nl]I'd also like to jump into a bath of pudding.
KSK/KSK0010780
A whole cake![nl]I'd like to try that, too.
RAK/RAK0043670
A pudding bath sounds traumatic, though....
KSK/KSK0010790
Hey, you got anything else, Ruri?[nl]Any other dreams?
@expose2
RUR/RUR0009880
....I would very much like to attend[nl]my best friend's wedding.
KSK/KSK0010800
....Huh?
RUR/RUR0009890
That's about all I have for dreams.
