Hey, hey, everyone![nl]How about we stop at a family restaurant on the way home?
RAK/RAK0018080
Sure, I don't really mind.
CTG/CTG0008750
Me too~![nl]Kosaki and the others and I were planning to do something[nl]like this anyway, so I'm totally fine with it!
KSK/KSK0007160
Yes. It'll be a lot more lively together with everyone.
RUR/RUR0000880
You mean together with Ichijo.
@expose
KSK/KSK0007170
R-Ruri!?
MRK/MRK0000440
Of course, wherever Raku dearest goes, I go![nl]Be it through fire or water, I will stick by his side....!
RAK/RAK0018090
O-Okay....just don't overdo it.
CTG/CTG0008760
And how about you, Tsugumi?
........
SSR/SSR0005580
Hahh....
RAK/RAK0018100
Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0005590
Aah!?!?[nl]W-What is it, Raku Ichijo!?
RAK/RAK0018110
Well, we were all thinking of stopping somewhere[nl]on the way home....
CTG/CTG0008775
You're going too, right, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0005600
....I'm sorry. I'll have to pass today,[nl]but you all go enjoy yourselves.
CTG/CTG0008780G
!?!?
RAK/RAK0018130
(You've gotta be kidding....[nl]Tsugumi turned down Chitoge's invitation....)
KSK/KSK0007190
What's wrong, Tsugumi?[nl]Is something the matter?
SSR/SSR0005610
N-No.... Nothing's wrong.
SSR/SSR0005620
It's nothing, so please don't worry.
CTG/CTG0008790
R-Really? I guess it's fine....
SSR/SSR0005630
Excuse me.
MRK/MRK0000460
It's most unusual for Tsugumi to reject[nl]an invitation from Kirisaki.
KSK/KSK0007200
Yeah. She's been seeming a little down lately.
RUR/RUR0000900
Chitoge, do you have any idea what's up?
CTG/CTG0008800
Nope. I don't have any ideas, either.
SSR/SSR0005640
....Hahh.
SYU/SYU0001260
Mm-hmm. I see.
RAK/RAK0018140
Have you figured it out?
SYU/SYU0001270
Absolutely![nl]Seishiro's sweet sigh just now....
@expose2
SYU/SYU0001280
That is the sigh of a maiden in lov---
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0001290
Gackpth!
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0018150
Waagh!
SSR/SSR0005650
Y-Y-Y-You idiot!
SSR/SSR0005660
T-T-There's no way I'm in love with anyone!
SSR/SSR0005670
Aaaaagh!?
KSK/KSK0007210
That sound just now....what was that?
SSR/SSR0005680
R-Right? What the hell was that sound?[nl]I don't know, either!
SSR/SSR0005690
W-W-W-W-Well then, everyone![nl]I'll be headed out first! See ya!
RAK/RAK0018160
H-Hey....Tsugumi!
CTG/CTG0008810
I wonder what's bothering her.
KSK/KSK0007220
I'm worried....
SYU/SYU0001300
U-Um....isn't anyone worried about me?
MRK/MRK0000470
I assure you that we aren't worried about you in the slightest.
RUR/RUR0000910
You had it coming.

Ooogh....why the hell did I take on this mission!?

SSR/SSR0005720
Master Claude.[nl]What's this little gadget that looks like a cellphone?
CLD/CLD0000600
Hmmm....this is an improved model of the "Lie Detector"[nl]that I lent you earlier.
SSR/SSR0005730
Huh!? This thing!?
CLD/CLD0000610
Yes....as you can see,[nl]our scientists succeeded in giving it a battery and[nl]reducing the form-factor. Amazing, isn't it?
SSR/SSR0005740
Y-Yeah....it is.
CLD/CLD0000620
And it is still 98% accurate, just like the old one.
CLD/CLD0000630
Seishiro! You must use this to expose[nl]that little brat's true intentions!
SSR/SSR0005750
Huh!? I-I must!?
CLD/CLD0000640
A device of this size should be easy to bring into school[nl]inconspicuously, and that should make it easy to get[nl]close to that boy.
SSR/SSR0005760
Well, that's true....
SSR/SSR0005770
If it turns out....[nl]Raku Ichijo does not have feelings for the mistress....
SSR/SSR0005780
How will she feel about that, I wonder....
CLD/CLD0000650
Please, there's no way that the mistress[nl]is serious about such a twerp!
CLD/CLD0000660
Of course, I think that he and the Shuei-Gumi are[nl]exploiting the mistress in some way!
SSR/SSR0005790
Are you sure....?
CLD/CLD0000670
The only one who can find out conclusively is....[nl]you, Seishiro! You're the only one!
CLD/CLD0000680
You must save the mistress from that savage little monkey!
SSR/SSR0005800
.........
SSR/SSR0005810
SSR/SSR0005820
....Understood.[nl]I will accept this assignment---
SSR/SSR0005830
---I accepted the assignment, but the school day ended[nl]before I could find a chance to carry it out.
SSR/SSR0005840
Raku Ichijo's true feelings, huh....
SSR/SSR0005850
Before, I would have been overjoyed to learn[nl]that the relationship between the mistress and Raku Ichijo[nl]was false.
SSR/SSR0005860
But now....all my feelings are jumbled up.
SSR/SSR0005870
....Ghh![nl]Not at all!
SSR/SSR0005880
In the first place, why should I even bother[nl]thinking about Raku Ichijo at all!?
SSR/SSR0005890
That aside, he's pretty much taken over all my thoughts....
RAK/RAK0018180
What's this about me?
SSR/SSR0005900
W-WAAAAAAAAAGGHH!
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0018190
Gack!?
SSR/SSR0005910
Aa......
RAK/RAK0018200
D-Don't just suddenly hit me!
SSR/SSR0005920
Y-You just appeared from out of nowhere![nl]Why are you even here!?[nl]I thought you went out with the others!
RAK/RAK0018210
....I let everyone go ahead.
RAK/RAK0018220
I noticed something was bothering you....
SSR/SSR0005930
Huh....?
SSR/SSR0005940
Were you....worried about me, by any chance?
RAK/RAK0018230
Is that bad?
SSR/SSR0005950
......H-Hmph! I would have to have fallen pretty far[nl]to have you worrying about me.
RAK/RAK0018240
What the hell....that isn't at all cute.
RAK/RAK0018250
So, what were you worried about?[nl]You said something about me a while ago.
SSR/SSR0005960
Ghhh.....don't get too cocky, Raku Ichijo![nl]It doesn't have anything to do with you!
SSR/SSR0005970
Gaack!
RAK/RAK0018260
Hmm? Did you hear that sound just now?
SSR/SSR0005980
R-Right!?[nl]It must have been one of the birds that lives here!
RAK/RAK0018270
No bird would make such a machine-like noise.
SSR/SSR0005990
Then you must have imagined it. There's no strange sound!
RAK/RAK0018280
(Hmmm.... It's suspicious how much she's trying to hide it.)
RAK/RAK0018290
(I think it was coming from somewhere around her chest....[nl] I'll try and find out what's up with some questions.)
