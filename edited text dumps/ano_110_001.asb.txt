Yo, Shuu! Heading home?[nl]Let's go together and stop somewhere on the way.
SYU/SYU0011550
Sorry! I've got some really urgent business to attend to.[nl]I'm leaving now.
RAK/RAK0061670
Is that right? Okay, we can go separately today.
@expose
@ＢＧＭ再生
SYU/SYU0011560
Another thing.... Don't tell anyone I was in[nl]a hurry to leave today, okay? I can't let anyone find out.
RAK/RAK0061680
Are you up to something bad?
SYU/SYU0011570
That's a secret. ♪[nl]See ya 'round, Raku!
RAK/RAK0061690
What could be so bad that he doesn't want[nl]people finding out?
RAK/RAK0061700
C-Could it be....he's committing a crime!?[nl]No, no, no, that's ridiculous....
RUR/RUR0011920
....How suspicious.
RAK/RAK0061710
Waaagh!? M-Miyamoto!?[nl]D-Did you hear that?
RUR/RUR0011930
I'm not sure what he usually does after school....[nl]But he must be up to something to be blatantly avoiding you like that.
RAK/RAK0061720
I-I guess so....
RUR/RUR0011940
I can't tell at all what that imbecile is up to,[nl]so this might be a good opportunity....
RUR/RUR0011950
Ichijo, we're gonna tail him.
RAK/RAK0061730
T-Tail him!? We are!?
RUR/RUR0011960
Aren't you curious at all?[nl]Don't you want to know what he's up to?
RAK/RAK0061740
Hmmmm....let's see....
I'm curious.
Whatever.
RAK/RAK0061750
Come to think of it, I don't know what he[nl]usually does after school, either.
RAK/RAK0061760
Of course, I kinda feel like he already knows[nl]everything about me already, ya know?
RUR/RUR0011970
Then let's go, Ichijo.[nl]We'll give that guy the usual comeuppance.
RAK/RAK0061770
Y-Yeah....
RAK/RAK0061780
(Miyamoto's a bit scary and vindictive....)
@フェードアウト
@背景変更
RUR/RUR0011980
There he is. From here on out, we follow[nl]from a safe distance.
RAK/RAK0061790
Okay....
SYU/SYU0011580
*humming* ♪
RUR/RUR0011990
He's just been going and coming back for a while now....[nl]What the hell is he doing?
RAK/RAK0061800
Maybe he's looking for someone?
RUR/RUR0012000
He seems to be in a real hurry, too....[nl]But why on earth?
@expose2
SYU/SYU0011590
....Hm?
RAK/RAK0061810
(Oh no!)
SYU/SYU0011600
....I must have imagined it.[nl]For a second there, it felt like Raku and Ruri were nearby....
RAK/RAK0061820
Phew....[nl]Think we're in the clear.
RUR/RUR0012010
But that was unexpected.[nl]Why did he think it was us, in particular?
RAK/RAK0061830
He's amazingly perceptive. If we don't watch out,[nl]he'll find us.
@ＢＧＭ停止
SYU/SYU0011610
Toooo late. ♪[nl]I found you already.
RUR/RUR0012020
....Huh!?
RAK/RAK0061840
Dude! How!?
SYU/SYU0011620
Hahaha! I guess even the two of you have[nl]a long way to go. It was totally obvious, I should say...[nl]Pfft! 
RAK/RAK0061850
When did you see us?
SYU/SYU0011630
I think it was around when you were[nl]talking at the school gate.
RAK/RAK0061860
That was basically right at the start!
RUR/RUR0012030
....So you knew everything right from the beginning?[nl]You sure had me completely fooled.
SYU/SYU0011640
Maaan, I'd been hoping if I acted like I really had[nl]something going on, then you'd take an interest in me, Ruri. ♪
RAK/RAK0061870
So, you're saying....[nl]That urgent business you had was made up!?
SYU/SYU0011650
Had I actually had something like that to do,[nl]I wouldn't have said it when and where I did, especially not[nl]in a way Ruri could have heard it!
SYU/SYU0011660
But, Ruri, you've been chasing after me so fervently,[nl]could it be.... Oh no! My heart is starting to pound! ★
RUR/RUR0012040
----
RUR/RUR0012050
Well....[nl]I will say that I've realized how I feel now.
SYU/SYU0011670
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0061880
M-Miyamoto, you're not, like, actually....!?
RUR/RUR0012060
Yep....I'll admit it, Maiko.[nl]I just can't stop thinking about you.
SYU/SYU0011680
Huh? ....For real!?
RUR/RUR0012070
Yep. Right now, my awareness of you is sticking around[nl]to the point that I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty[nl]just to get rid of you!
SYU/SYU0011690
H-Huh....? Are you angry with me?[nl]Hey, what's that you're taking outta your bag?
RUR/RUR0012080
It's an anti-molestation device that can repel even bears.[nl]It's finally time for me to put this to use.
SYU/SYU0011700
Gaaah! I can hear it making sparking noises![nl]Please no, Ruri! If you use that on me....![nl]Stop pointing it at me so silently!
RAK/RAK0061890
Hahh.... What a waste of time.[nl]I'm going home....
SYU/SYU0011710
Raku!? Don't just leave me here!
RUR/RUR0012090
Don't worry, this will only hurt for a second.[nl]....Maybe.
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0011720
I'll do anything! I'm sorry![nl]Please forgive meeee!
@イベント終了処理
RAK/RAK0061900
I don't really care.
RUR/RUR0012100
Oh, so you don't want to find this out[nl]about your best friend?
RAK/RAK0061910
No, maybe I shouldn't say I don't care.
RAK/RAK0061920
But I'm sure he has secrets he'd like to keep even from me,[nl]and it wouldn't exactly be very friendly of me to[nl]expose them.
@ザクシャるり・中
RUR/RUR0012110
....I see. So you do say nice things sometimes.
RAK/RAK0061930
That's why I'm not gonna do it.[nl]If you wanna follow him, I'm not stopping you.
RUR/RUR0012120
If that's the case, I may as well go home.[nl]See you around, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0061940
See ya, Miyamoto.
