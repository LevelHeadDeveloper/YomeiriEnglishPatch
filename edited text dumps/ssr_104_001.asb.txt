Alright, time to turn in your English quizzes.[nl]When I call your name, go ahead and bring me yours.
MSA/MSA0000150G
Okaaay!
RAK/RAK0053270
Crap....I didn't review thoroughly enough,[nl]so I'm not sure I did well on this....
KYK/KYK0000360
Kirisaki.
CTG/CTG0013830
Here you go!
KYK/KYK0000370
Hey, just what we expected from an American transfer[nl]student. A well-deserved 100 points for you.
@expose
CTG/CTG0013840
Hehe, of course!
KSK/KSK0016700
That's amazing, Chitoge!
CTG/CTG0013850
Hehehe, really? If you have any trouble with this subject,[nl]just let me know, okay?
RAK/RAK0053280
(As usual, Chitoge can *really* study.)
KYK/KYK0000380
Next up, Ichijo.
RAK/RAK0053290
O-Okay!
KYK/KYK0000390
....Hmm. This isn't good, but it isn't bad, either.[nl]You stayed the same as usual.
RAK/RAK0053300
R-Right....
@時間経過演出
SSR/SSR0012670
Heh.... You really are a pathetic man. How do you expect[nl]to be a good lover for the Mistress like this?
RAK/RAK0053310
S-Shut up![nl]What kind of score did you get?
SSR/SSR0012680
A perfect score with room to spare.
RAK/RAK0053320
Nghhh.....[nl]You did great as usual.
SSR/SSR0012690
.....A-Ahem. W-Well, if you're this bad,[nl]you'll probably embarrass the Mistress.
SSR/SSR0012700
It cannot be helped.[nl]May I walk you through where you made mistakes?
SSR/SSR0012710
That is....if you insist.
Sounds like a pain in the butt.
Let her help
RAK/RAK0053330
No, I'm good.
SSR/SSR0012720
....You need to accept other people's generosity!
RAK/RAK0053340
Which is it....?
SSR/SSR0012730
Shut up and listen!
RAK/RAK0053350
Fine, fine.[nl]Thanks for helping me out, them.
SSR/SSR0012740
M-Mhm....
RAK/RAK0053360
Seriously!? Tsugumi, you're a great teacher![nl]Will you really help me!?
@ザクシャ誠士郎・中
SSR/SSR0012750
....I-Is that right?[nl]I'm a great teacher, huh.
SSR/SSR0012760
You ready? First of all, this problem here....
RAK/RAK0053370
.....!
SSR/SSR0012770
Mgh....W-What is it?[nl]Are you listening to me?
RAK/RAK0053380
Y-Yeah. I'm listening, I'm listening.
SSR/SSR0012780
Okay. Then let us continue.
RAK/RAK0053390
(She's so close! Every time she teaches me,[nl] she gets so close!)
RAK/RAK0053400
(I like Onodera, why the hell is[nl] my heart pounding....wait, it's this pattern again!)
SSR/SSR0012790
Hey, stop spacing out![nl]Listen carefully!
RAK/RAK0053410
Huh? T-To what!?
SSR/SSR0012800
To what I'm saying!
SSR/SSR0012810
Jeez....could you try to take this[nl]a little bit more seriously?
RAK/RAK0053420
O-Okay.....[nl]Sorry. After all, you're going to all this trouble for me.
SSR/SSR0012820
Who said it was for you!?[nl]It's for, ummm.....the Mistress! Don't get the wrong idea!
RAK/RAK0053430
Got it, got it.[nl]Don't worry about it.
SSR/SSR0012830
You really and truly get it?
SSR/SSR0012840
Then I'll have you take a retest for me sometime.
RAK/RAK0053440
Oh. A goal like that should keep me motivated.
SSR/SSR0012850
Hm.... Then, we'll use a carrot-and-stick approach.[nl]If you can get a perfect score on the retest,[nl]I'll do any one thing you want.
RAK/RAK0053450
Oooh, that's good![nl]Now I'm all fired up!
SSR/SSR0012860
However, if you miss even one question,[nl]you must break up with the Mistress.[nl]Are we clear?
RAK/RAK0053460
Too risky! Too risky!
SSR/SSR0012870
Then that's how seriously you need to take this!
RAK/RAK0053470
(Seriously.... If I make a mistake and have to[nl] break up with Chitoge, the Beehive and Shuei-Gumi[nl] will start an all-out war!)
SSR/SSR0012880
Well, do your very best.[nl]Or die trying.
RAK/RAK0053480
(Ooogh.... The fate of this city[nl] depends on one little English quiz! I can't believe it!)
