(Oh no! I was so caught up in taking care of the animals[nl] that I missed the bell!)
RAK/RAK0075710
(I'm gonna start going a bit faster here....)
MRK/MRK0012680
Raku dearessssst!
RAK/RAK0075720
Bah!? Tachibana!?[nl]Where'd you come fr--

MRK/MRK0012700
I'm sorry, Raku dearest. ★[nl]I wasn't expecting you to come around the corner.... Are you okay?
RAK/RAK0075730
....You deliberately fell on top of me after we collided,[nl]didn't you?
MRK/MRK0012710
You're just imagining that. ★
RAK/RAK0075740
Is that so....?[nl]Okay, can you get off me, then?
MRK/MRK0012720
I cannot.[nl]I was so surprised that my legs buckled and I can't stand.★
RAK/RAK0075750
Huh....!?
MRK/MRK0012730
Anyway, your chest is so thick and muscular, Raku dearest.
MRK/MRK0012740
It's hardly as good as my father's,[nl]but it's just right for me.
Get her off you
Enjoy the situation
RAK/RAK0075760
Tachibana! Just get off me!
MRK/MRK0012750
Aaah!
@背景変更
MRK/MRK0012760
Jeez, you're so pushy, Raku dearest....
@ザクシャ万里花・小
RAK/RAK0075770
Don't talk in such a misleading way.
RAK/RAK0075780
Anyway, it doesn't look like you're hurt.[nl]Should we get going?
@expose
MRK/MRK0012770
....Honestly, you're so boring.
RAK/RAK0075790
(I didn't think Tachibana would be this light....[nl] And her body is also pretty slender....)
RAK/RAK0075800
Hey! Stop rubbing your cheek into me![nl]If anyone sees us like this--

CTG/CTG0022810
And just what are you two doing?
RAK/RAK0075810
(Oh noooo!)
SSR/SSR0021130
You're getting awfully carried away there[nl]for the middle of the day, Raku Ichijo....
RAK/RAK0075820
Wait, wait![nl]I'm not sure where you've been watching from, but this was[nl]just a coincidence....
CTG/CTG0022820
There's no way a coincidence would be that dramatic!
SSR/SSR0021140
Rather, Marika Tachibana![nl]Get the hell away from Raku Ichijo and stay away!
MRK/MRK0012780
Kyaaah, I'm scared![nl]I'd better be going.
MRK/MRK0012790
You should all head back to the classroom,[nl]or you'll be in big trouble.
SSR/SSR0021150
You're one to talk!
CTG/CTG0022830
I guess we'd better go settle this somewhere after all!
RAK/RAK0075830
(Tachibana.... You can run just fine, huh.)
RAK/RAK0075840
(Hm? What did she just drop?)
RAK/RAK0075850
(This.... I have this picture, too.[nl] But isn't this one Tachibana's?)
RAK/RAK0075860
(Why on Earth would she carry something like this around with her?)
