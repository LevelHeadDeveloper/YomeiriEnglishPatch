Alright, I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding....[nl]But can I ask you something?
CTG/CTG0005890
I've been listening to you for a while,[nl]and I think I'm picking up on something.
CTG/CTG0005900
....A-Ahem. Ummm....
CTG/CTG0005910
It feels like, I dunno,[nl]you've been awfully nice to me for a while now....
CTG/CTG0005920
It kinda seems like you....
CTG/CTG0005930
L...li.....
@ctg_005_201_02
CTG/CTG0005940
Well, I'll try to stay out of your way[nl]as much as I can, then.
CTG/CTG0005950
Whether or not you like it,[nl]we're gonna be stuck together for---

SSR/SSR0000130
Mistress, it's time to go home!
CTG/CTG0005960
Huh....?
RAK/RAK0003830
That sounds like....
CTG/CTG0005970
Tsugumi!?
SSR/SSR0000140
Mistress, it's time to head home.[nl]It's already awfully late at nught.
SSR/SSR0000150
Hm? What's the matter? You're staring awfully hard at me....
RAK/RAK0003840
W-What are you doing here, Tsugumi!?
@expose
SSR/SSR0000160
I feel like you should know by now.[nl]I've been with you ever since we left for this island.
CTG/CTG0005980
This island....?[nl]Isn't this island a deserted island?
SSR/SSR0000170
Deserted island? What are you talking about?[nl]This is a private beach owned by the Beehive.
CTG/CTG0005990
Huh? Huuuhh!? What do you mean!?
CTG/CTG0006000
I mean, we got shipwrecked in our rubber boat[nl]and washed up on this beach.
CTG/CTG0006010
How could we be back on the island we came from?
SSR/SSR0000180
Shipwrecked? Washed ashore?
SSR/SSR0000190
Oh, I see....[nl]I think I understand the story.
SSR/SSR0000200
Mistress, is it possible you mistakenly believed[nl]that you were marooned?
RAK/RAK0003850
Mistakenly? What do you mean?
SSR/SSR0000210
Listen, Raku Ichijo. Like I mentioned earlier,[nl]we are on the beach on the other side of the island[nl]where we landed.
RAK/RAK0003860
Other side....?
SSR/SSR0000220
Yes. Everyone's about a 30 minute walk[nl]through the jungle from here.
SSR/SSR0000230
I'm certain you and the mistress believed you were[nl]marooned when you really drifted about halfway[nl]around the island on your boat.
CTG/CTG0006020
T-Then that means we--
RAK/RAK0003870
You mean we weren't even marooned in the first place?
SSR/SSR0000240
That's exactly what I mean.
@expose
SSR/SSR0000250
First of all, I have been watching over the mistress for a[nl]long time. She could not have been in any danger[nl]of getting marooned.
RAK/RAK0003880
Hahhh.....what the hell, man....[nl]I really thought we were stuck here....
CTG/CTG0006030
Yeah, me too....[nl]I'm absolutely drained from all of this....
CTG/CTG0006040
Also, Tsugumi's kinda at fault here, too.[nl]Why didn't you tell us if you knew we were here?
SSR/SSR0000260
W-Well....
SSR/SSR0000270
I can't just interrupt two lovers when they're talking[nl]about their love so harmoniously, can I?
SSR/SSR0000280
E-Even with that said....[nl]I can't just interrupt two lovers when they're talking[nl]about their love, can I?
CTG/CTG0006050
T-Talking about our love....[nl]Is that what our survival efforts looked like to you, Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0000290
That's what that was? It looked like you two were flirting[nl]while staring at the starry night sky....
SSR/SSR0000300
There wasn't the slightest opportunity for me to intervene.
RAK/RAK0003890
....Tsugumi?
SSR/SSR0000310
That's what that was? It looked like you two were flirting[nl]while staring at the starry night sky.
SSR/SSR0000320
Master Claude seemed pretty eager to try to snipe you,[nl]Raku Ichijo. It was all I could do to stop him.
RAK/RAK0003900
...Well, that was great work. Good job, Tsugumi.
SSR/SSR0000330
Anyway, we should head back now.[nl]The boss and Master Claude will be worried.
RAK/RAK0003910
Good grief, so this all turned out to be[nl]a huge misunderstanding, then....
CTG/CTG0006060
U-Um, Raku. About what I was saying earlier....
RAK/RAK0003920
I understand. You were feeling anxious because[nl]you thought we were marooned.[nl]Let's both just sweep this under the carpet.
CTG/CTG0006070
No. That wasn't it....
@ＢＧＭ再生
CTG/CTG0006080
To be completely honest, I was thinking that[nl]having to live here with you would actually be fun.
RAK/RAK0003930
Huh?
CTG/CTG0006090
But, after all, I'm not the one who should[nl]be by your side. I'm sure of that.
RAK/RAK0003940
Huh? What do you mean?
CTG/CTG0006100
Well, if you don't know, you don't know, really.
RAK/RAK0003950
Hey, that's not good enough![nl]Just tell me outright!
CTG/CTG0006110
Hehe, it's fine, it's fine.[nl]We're done talking about this! Let's hurry up and leave!
CTG/CTG0006120
...Hahhhh, I can't wait to take a nice hot shower[nl]and get back to my bed!
RAK/RAK0003960
The hell? What a weirdo....
