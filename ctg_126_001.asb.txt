CLD/CLD0002330
My sincerest apologies, Mistress.
CLD/CLD0002340
Siiiiighhhhh......
RAK/RAK0072070
Hey, what's got you all depressed?
CLD/CLD0002350
To tell you the truth, I have been called abroad[nl]on short notice for a mission starting today....[nl]I will not be able to return to Japan for a while.
CTG/CTG0020480
Huh? Really?
CLD/CLD0002360
....Mistress.... After all this time I have spent watching[nl]over you, suddenly this happens.... I, your Claude,[nl]cannot apologize to you enough!
CTG/CTG0020490
It's fine, don't worry about it.[nl]Tsugumi's still gonna be here, so I'll really be totally fine[nl]without you!
CLD/CLD0002370
Ohh, Mistress![nl]What a splendid young lady you have become....[nl]I'm so happyyyy!
CLD/CLD0002380
....Hey, you Ichijo brat.
RAK/RAK0072080
W-What is it?
CLD/CLD0002390
If you ever make the mistress cry, I won't ever forgive you.[nl]And if I hear so much as a breath of a rumor that you did,[nl]I will come even from the other side of the Earth to kill you...
I won't do that.
I'm actually gonna protect her.
RAK/RAK0072090
Man, sounds dangerous.[nl]I won't do anything like that,[nl]so go do your mission without worrying.
CLD/CLD0002400
Ghhh....[nl]I am overwhelmingly regretful and sorrowful[nl]that I must leave you unchecked like this....
RAK/RAK0072110
Man, sounds dangerous. Don't worry.[nl]I'll protect Chitoge with everything I've got.

CLD/CLD0002440
Mistress....![nl]Take good care of yourself....
CTG/CTG0020510
Okay. You take care of yourself too.
CTG/CTG0020520
But I gotta say I will miss you a little....[nl]You've been looking after me for a long time, after all.

Um, I don't know what you mean by "how 'bout that"....
CLD/CLD0002500
Mistress! Your humble Claude will always![nl]Always and forever![nl]Watch over you forever and everrrrrr!
CTG/CTG0020540
I-I see....[nl]That's good, I guess.
