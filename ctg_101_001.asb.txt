Maaan, I'm starved![nl]Lunchtime, lunchtime~! ★
RAK/RAK0067590
Chitoge, your lunchboxes always look so lavish.[nl]There's lobster, caviar, and all kinds of expensive things[nl]in there.
KSK/KSK0017730
Really, they do. They look beautiful, and I'm[nl]honestly jealous that I can't have such a delicious[nl]lunch every day.
CTG/CTG0015640
Is that right....?[nl]But for me, lunch has always looked like this,[nl]so I don't know what a normal lunchbox looks like.
KSK/KSK0017740
I see....
@expose
CTG/CTG0015650
Hehehee....[nl]I wonder what's for lunch today?[nl]Time to ea--

CTG/CTG0015680
.....G-....Ghh.....
RAK/RAK0067610
Huh!? Wai--!?[nl]Don't cry over this!
CTG/CTG0015690
Ooogh, this....can't be happening....[nl]The only thing that got me through the morning classes[nl]was knowing I'd get to eat lunch at the end....
KSK/KSK0017760
C-Calm down, Chitoge....
CTG/CTG0015700
Waaaaaah! Come back, lunch!
Offer her some of your lunch
Leave her alone
RAK/RAK0067620
....It can't be helped.[nl]Here, you can have some of my lunch, so cheer up.
CTG/CTG0015710
Ooogh, I won't accept mercy from a bean sprout.....
CTG/CTG0015720
.....Is it really okay if I have some?
RAK/RAK0067630
*Now* you want it!?
CTG/CTG0015730
But then you wouldn't have any lunch....
RAK/RAK0067640
So you plan to eat all of it. ....Well, that's fine.[nl]I'll grab something from the canteen later,[nl]so eat as much as you want!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0015740

Oh, you can have some of mine, too![nl]Chitoge, is there anything here you'd like?
CTG/CTG0015750
Y-You too, Kosaki....[nl]Thank you so muuuuuch!
RAK/RAK0067650
(Well, she won't starve if I don't do anything. Worst case[nl] scenario, she can just buy something from the canteen.)
KSK/KSK0017780
Oh, you can have some of my lunch, Chitoge![nl]Here, what do you want?
CTG/CTG0015760

CLD/CLD0002270
Mistress, pardon me, but it's lunch time.
CTG/CTG0015770
Aaagh! You startled me....[nl]Claude, what are you doing inside the school?
CLD/CLD0002280
Actually, due to a mistake on our part, you were given the[nl]wrong multi-tiered lunchbox when you left this morning.[nl]Here is the lunchbox you were supposed to have.
CTG/CTG0015780
Ah....so that's what happened.
CLD/CLD0002290
I've caused you such an inconvenience during your[nl]precious lunch period, mistress.... I'm so sorry!
CLD/CLD0002300
I am willing to pay for this with my death....
CTG/CTG0015790
Uhh, there's no need for that.[nl]I've got my lunch now, no problem,[nl]so please make sure you don't die.
CLD/CLD0002310
Ghh....Mistress! Such mercy....[nl]I will take my leave now. Ghhh.....
CTG/CTG0015800
Yes, yes, thanks.
RAK/RAK0067660
Lucky break, Chitoge.
KSK/KSK0017790
Yeah. Oh....but, Chitoge, your lunch is so big,[nl]I'm not sure you have room for the food we gave you.
KSK/KSK0017800
Yeah. Oh....but, Chitoge, your lunch is so big,[nl]I'm not sure you have room for the food I gave you.

RAK/RAK0067670
Alright, I'll have....
CTG/CTG0015850

RAK/RAK0067680
Huh!? I can't have some!?
CTG/CTG0015860
Hehe. Just kidding.
CTG/CTG0015870
I'll give you one bite.[nl]Here you go.
CTG/CTG0015880

Well, compared to the kind of full-blown stuff[nl]you've got in there, my lunch doesn't stack up.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0015920

RAK/RAK0067730
