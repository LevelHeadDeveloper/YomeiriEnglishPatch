When you calm down and think about it,[nl]it's true there are a lot of ways to look at it......
CTG/CTG0002280
......Thanks, Raku.[nl]I've calmed down a bit, thanks to you.
RAK/RAK0001150
I see. That's great.
RAK/RAK0001160
Nice. Let's go grab that notebook, then.
CTG/CTG0002290
Mm.

Calm down, Chitoge! It was just a joke, a joke!

@ＢＧＭ再生
CLD/CLD0000060
Guh.....
CLD/CLD0000070
M-my apologies, Young Miss.[nl]It looks like I've terribly startled you.
CTG/CTG0002480
C-Claude? For real??[nl]You're not a ghost?
CLD/CLD0000080
Of course. Of what may you be speaking about?
CTG/CTG0002490
Well.....for starters....why are you covered in blood.....?
CLD/CLD0000090
Ah, this. This is not blood.[nl]These are simply just paintball stains.
CLD/CLD0000100
Due to my negligence, I was struck by Seishirou a few times.[nl]Well, I still haven't lost the fight.
RAK/RAK0001310
Paintballs?[nl]What're you doing with paintballs?
CLD/CLD0000110
Hmph. The Ichijou brat, huh.
CLD/CLD0000120
I have no obligation to explain this to you......[nl]But I'll humor you this time.
CLD/CLD0000130
This is what you would call[nl]our Beehive combat training.
CLD/CLD0000140
Ever since our compromise with the Shuei group,[nl] our gang has been pent up with energy.[nl]This is also a way of releasing that steam.
RAK/RAK0001320
So in other words,[nl]this is like an airsoft fight among gang members?
CLD/CLD0000150
Mmhm.
RAK/RAK0001330
Why purposely do that on school grounds......
CTG/CTG0002500
Hm? Wait a sec. Then, what were the rumored[nl]knocking and groaning sounds?
RAK/RAK0001340
I'm sure it was just these guys goofing around.[nl]The "blood-stained" room was probably also just paint,[nl]as well.
CLD/CLD0000160
Rumors? What are you referring to?
RAK/RAK0001350
Well, actually......
@時間経過演出
CLD/CLD0000170
Mmm. I do remember previously there was an incident[nl]of a schoolgirl getting caught in the crossfire...
CLD/CLD0000180
I carried her to the gate out of courtesy, but.....[nl]To think that became the source of a ghost story.
CTG/CTG0002510
Sooo, the true culprits were you guys all along?[nl]I've been scared straight by my own men this whole time?[nl]Uwah, this pisses me off.....!
CTG/CTG0002520
I mean, why the airsoft? Why at school!?[nl]What on earth were y'all thinking?[nl] Hell, you weren't thinking at all!
CLD/CLD0000190
B-but, Young Miss. Maintaining combat fitness of[nl]our troops is of absolute necessity.....
CTG/CTG0002530
Shut up! I don't care about your excuses.[nl]From now on, absolutely no airsoft at the school!!
CLD/CLD0000200
N-no way!? But Young Miss, to[nl]the Beehive, this is essential.....
CTG/CTG0002540
Shut it! Causing trouble to everyone around you,[nl]to hell with all your "training" and "venting"!
CLD/CLD0000210
Ugh....!
RAK/RAK0001360
Haha.....As soon as you knew the truth,[nl]you got confident again real fast.
CTG/CTG0002550
What, you got a problem?
RAK/RAK0001370
Nah. It's just that I can't believe this scary woman[nl]is the same person as the one who was so[nl]scared she couldn't move earlier.
CTG/CTG0002560
Hmph. Save it, stupid bean sprout!
CLD/CLD0000220
Stupid.......bean sprout?
CTG/CTG0002570
W-well, let's get the notebook and go home already![nl]Darling.
RAK/RAK0001380
A-absolutely, honey.
