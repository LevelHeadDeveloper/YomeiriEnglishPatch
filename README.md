# YomeiriEnglishPatch
The English translation patch for Nisekoi: Yomeiri!?

# About
This is an **unofficial** patch for Nisekoi: Yomeiri!? to translate it into English.

# Installation

To install this patch, you will need an **unencrypted** dump of the original game. If you have an encrypted dump (e.g. a NoNpDrm dump), put it in a .zip or a .vpk and install it into Vita3K. Then find Vita3k's data directory and navigate to ux0/app/PCSG00397. The decrypted game will be found here.

This patch has been distributed as two xdelta binary patches. Grab them from the Releases tab and get the patching tool here: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/.

In the game folder, navigate to the "pack" subdirectory and back up all.apk and fs.apk (which hold most of the game's data.)

Use the patcher you downloaded to apply all.xdelta to all.apk, and fs.xdelta to fs.apk. If need be, rename the patched files back to "all.apk" and "fs.apk".

**PLEASE NOTE:** the patch can only be applied to the *original* apk files. In other words, **you cannot apply the binary patches to a file that was already patched**. To upgrade to a newer version of the patch, copy your backups of the unpatched files into the game's */pack/* folder and patch *those*.
