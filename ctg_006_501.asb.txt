Huh....!?
CTG/CTG0007630
H-Hang on, what kinda....!?
RAK/RAK0006550
I meant exactly what I just said.
RAK/RAK0006560
Even if you are a crass, violent woman who can't cook,[nl]you're the one I want to be with, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0007640
.....W-W-W-Wha...!?[nl]I mean, Mitoge's....even though you've got the ideal[nl]girl right at your fingertips!?
RAK/RAK0006570
I'm not looking for the ideal girl.[nl]You're the whole reason I've had so much fun[nl]up until this point.
RAK/RAK0006580
I love spending every day with you.[nl]And that's why I came to get you.
CTG/CTG0007650
R-Raku....you idiot....[nl]Why'd you have to go and choose me....
RAK/RAK0006590
I don't want to hear that from the sort of idiot[nl]who doesn't realize just how wonderful she really is.
CTG/CTG0007660
*sniffle* *sob*[nl]That's a cool thing to say, you bean sprout,[nl]you typical bean sprout....!
RAK/RAK0006600
You're just fine the way you are.[nl]You're not unwanted, at least not by me.
CTG/CTG0007670
*sob*....[nl]Rakuuuuuu......!
RAK/RAK0006610
Woah, wai--[nl]Don't just suddenly hug me!
CTG/CTG0007680
*sniff* *sniff*[nl]It-it's just....I'm so happy....!
RAP/RAP0000180
.....Well, well, looks like things have finally settled down.
RAK/RAK0006620
Huh? Dad!?
SSR/SSR0000610
Mistress....thank goodness.
CLD/CLD0000420
Leaving the hall like that, just so you could[nl]bring the mistress in here for a cuddle....[nl]You deserve to die, punk....!
SSR/SSR0000620
Leaving the hall like that, just so you could[nl]bring the mistress in here for a cuddle....[nl]Heh, that's inexcusable, Raku Ichijo!
CLD/CLD0000430
Indeed. You deserve to die, punk....!
RAK/RAK0006630
Wait, how'd you know to come here....?
RAP/RAP0000190
Well, we heard you talking from outside the room.
RAP/RAP0000200
We heard some terrible pickup line like[nl]"Please stay by my side" that really set my teeth on edge.
RAK/RAK0006640
Gaah!? You heard that....!?
CTG/CTG0007690
Waaah....y-You stupid bean sprout....[nl]You're embarrassing me! Like, a lot!
RAK/RAK0006650
I-I'm embarrassed too, okay!?
RAK/RAK0006660
(But at least everyone seems to know Chitoge's here.[nl] Case closed, I guess....)

CTP/CTP0000220
It looks like we should be able to continue the[nl]ceremony at this rate. It seems Raku and Chitoge[nl]are getting along again.
RAK/RAK0006670G
Huh?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAP/RAP0000210
Alright, lowlifes![nl]Bring the guests of honor back to the hall!
RAK/RAK0006680
T-The engagement thing's still going!?
CTG/CTG0007710
Actually, I....[nl]I don't remember wishing for that....
RAK/RAK0006690
Huhh!? So this is a different thing entirely!?
RYU/RYU0000100
Okay, right this way, young master and young mistress.[nl]There'll be plenty of time later for your waaaarm embrace~.
RAK/RAK0006700
Oh, no. This isn't, like, a hug or anything....
RYU/RYU0000110
Hey, hey, no need to be so shy 'bout it, young master.
RAK/RAK0006710
No, no, you don't understand!
RAP/RAP0000220
Come on, everyone! Let's head back to the hall[nl]and continue with the engagement!
SEA/SEA0000030G
YEAAAAAHHH!

KSK/KSK0000630
C-Chitoge, I heard that you....
KSK/KSK0000640
I heard you're engaged to Ichijo.....[nl]That's great news....yeah....
CTG/CTG0007720
Hahaha....I guess the cat's outta the bag, then.[nl]Well, half of it was by accident.
CTG/CTG0007730
Hey, Kosaki?[nl]What's with the vacant stare?
RUR/RUR0000420
Well....don't ask her that, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0007740
??
MRK/MRK0000320
Mgh, so they're engaged....[nl]Looks like she struck before I could.
MRK/MRK0000330
Hey, Raku dearest, will you move to Arabia with me?
RAK/RAK0006730
Huh!? Why all of a sudden?
MRK/MRK0000340
Well, because bigamy's legal there, of course.
MRK/MRK0000350
If Kirisaki's going to marry you, Raku dearest,[nl]then I'm shooting for the position of second wife....[nl]That's how I roll!
SSR/SSR0000630
Hey, Marika Tachibana. Don't you think you're being a little[nl]inappropriate during the joyous occasion of the mistress's[nl]engagement? What with all this "second wife" nonsense.....
MRK/MRK0000360
My, oh my.[nl]You've got some interesting reading material there, Tsugumi.[nl]What's this? "The Moral Significance of Mistresses"....
SSR/SSR0000640
No, it isn't....[nl]This is, um....!
RAK/RAK0006740
(I guess it's true that the news of an engagement[nl] will typically catch people off guard....)
SYU/SYU0000530
Hey, hey, Raku. My sources tell me you proposed[nl]to Kirisaki in a pretty passionate way.
SYU/SYU0000540
The way I heard it, the two of you were alone in a dark[nl]room, sharing an embrace, when you declared your love in a[nl]very romantic way. It's already the talk of the whole school.
RAK/RAK0006750
Y-You idiot! It's not like I proposed or anything!
RAK/RAK0006760
Hey, Chitoge....[nl]I think we should explain this to everyone, don't you?[nl]All this gossip is geting on my nerves.
CTG/CTG0007750
Really? I think it's fine.
CTG/CTG0007760
I don't think it's annoying at all. Besides....
RAK/RAK0060010
Besides?
CTG/CTG0007770
Now, instead of being fake lovers,[nl]we're real lovers, right?

RAK/RAK0006780
Well, then....[nl]I guess I'll drink it without any hesitation.
RAK/RAK0006790
...Gulp...!
RAK/RAK0006800
Gluck....gluck.....
RAK/RAK0006810
....Aah!
RAP/RAP0000230
Oooh, nice job drinking that, Raku!
CTP/CTP0000230
Now, Raku's as much a part of our family[nl]as if he were my own....so there's that.
SSR/SSR0000650
Congratulations....mistress.
SSR/SSR0000660
Raku....Ichijo. You too.
SSR/SSR0000670
Congratulations....mistress!
SSR/SSR0000680
....A-And, just in case,[nl]I'll congratulate you, too, Raku Ichijo.
CLD/CLD0000440
Dammit....I can't do this....!
RYU/RYU0000120
Young maaaaaaaster![nl]Congratulationsssssssss!
RAK/RAK0006820
(This was.....the right call, I think.)
CTG/CTG0007780
RAK/RAK0006830
(!![nl] Chitoge!?)
MTG/MTG0002110
Mr. Raku, where are you going?
RAK/RAK0006840
No, just now, for a second....[nl]I thought I heard Chitoge's voice....
MTG/MTG0002120
Hehehe. What are you talking about?[nl]I'm Chitoge, Mr. Raku.
RAK/RAK0006850
Huh....? Yeahh....
......
RAK/RAK0006860
I see....
RAK/RAK0006870
I guess you're right.[nl]....Sorry.
MTG/MTG0002130
No problem.
MTG/MTG0002140
Mr. Raku, I look forward to a long and happy life together.
RAK/RAK0006880
Yeah. Likewise....Chitoge.

(With the blessings of many people,[nl] Mitoge and I were engaged.)
RAK/RAK0006910
(Then came spring, then summer, then fall,[nl] then winter, then spring again.)
RAK/RAK0006920
(After a few more seasons with my sweet lover,[nl] I wasn't a student anymore.)
RAK/RAK0006930
(I'm still keeping in touch with my other friends[nl] from those days, like Shuu and Onodera.)
RAK/RAK0006940
(I don't see them a lot these days,[nl] but they're still great people.)
RAK/RAK0006950
(But what has changed, however....)
RAK/RAK0006960
I'm home....
MTG/MTG0002150
Welcome home, darling.[nl]Are you feeling alright? You look a bit pale.
RAK/RAK0006970
I've had a lot of work lately....[nl]I'm still young, so they're giving me a lot of work.
MTG/MTG0002160
It isn't easy working for the government, is it?[nl]You should have some dinner and spend the[nl]rest of the day resting.
RAK/RAK0006980
Sorry, I don't think I have much of an appetite today....[nl]*cough* *cough*
MTG/MTG0002170
Oh, your forehead is burning up.[nl]I think you might have a cold.
RAK/RAK0006990
Could be. I am feeling a bit sluggish.
MTG/MTG0002180
Well, I'll make you something easy on the stomach.[nl]How about rice porridge?
RAK/RAK0007000
Sure, thanks.
RAK/RAK0007010
(Come to think of it, I think Chitoge made me[nl] some rice porridge at some point back in the day....)
RAK/RAK0007020
(But when was that....?[nl] I think Onodera was with us, too....)
MTG/MTG0002190
Here, enjoy.[nl]It's highly nourishing rice porridge with egg.
RAK/RAK0007030
Thanks for dinner.....
MTG/MTG0002200
How's the saltiness? Did I add too much salt?
RAK/RAK0007040
No, it's delicious.
MTG/MTG0002210
I see. Thank goodness.
RAK/RAK0007050
....Hey, Chitoge.
MTG/MTG0002220
What is it, darling?
RAK/RAK0007060
When did you....learn how to[nl]make such delicious porridge?
RAK/RAK0007070
You made me some a long time ago,[nl]and it tasted pretty bad, like---
MTG/MTG0002230
When was this? I don't think I've[nl]ever made rice porridge wrong.[nl]You must be misremembering.
RAK/RAK0007080
Yeah....I probably am.
RAK/RAK0007090
You'd never make a mistake when it comes to cooking.[nl]Hahaha.....
RAK/RAK0007100
(Yeah, I'm certain I'm misremembering.)
RAK/RAK0007110
(I can't even imagine Chitoge failing at cooking.[nl] I must be--)
