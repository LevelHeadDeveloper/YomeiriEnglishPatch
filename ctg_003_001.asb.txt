A date at the game center is an interesting choice, huh?
RAK/RAK0001390
We've already exhausted all the date spots in the city.[nl]I thought it'd be good to go to this[nl]kind of place every once in a while.
@expose
CTG/CTG0002610
Mm, breaking the norm.[nl]Not a bad idea.
RAK/RAK0001400
Alright, then why don't we get going....[nl]Maybe with a little friendly competition?
CTG/CTG0002620
Ooh, yeah.[nl]Why don't we make the loser buy the other a drink?[nl]Just so you know, I'm not gonna go easy on you.
RAK/RAK0001410
Bring it on.
CTG/CTG0002630
So, what game are we gonna play?
RAK/RAK0001420
Hmm....
RAK/RAK0001430
What about that crane game over there?[nl]Whoever gets the target first wins.
CTG/CTG0002640
Sure~. So why don't we make the target....
CTG/CTG0002650
Ah, what about that. The small gorilla keychain.[nl]It looks a lot like the one you gave me a while back.
RAK/RAK0001440
It really does.....[nl]They've made a series out of that, I guess.
RAK/RAK0001450
Okay, I'll give you the first move.[nl]We'll call it "ladies first" at that.
CTG/CTG0002660
Oh? You sure you want to do that?
CTG/CTG0002670
All I have to do is lift it and drop it in the box, right?[nl]I'll win before you can play, y'know?
RAK/RAK0001460
Don't you have some confidence on you. Just do it, then.
CTG/CTG0002680
Watch closely![nl]I'll show you some graceful technique.
CTG/CTG0002690
First, let's put in the coin, and....
CTG/CTG0002700
*humming*
CTG/CTG0002710
*losing confidence*
........
CTG/CTG0002720
Ugh. So unlucky.....
RAK/RAK0001470
Seems like it's actually not so easy, huh?
CTG/CTG0002730
That's strange. It was perfectly around it as well,[nl]but the arm just doesn't lift it.
CTG/CTG0002740
Surely the machine is just broken, isn't it?[nl]Definitely.[nl]The arm's even weaker than yours.
RAK/RAK0001480
No, hold up. From the start, all of these machines[nl]are like that for this kind of thing.
RAK/RAK0001490
Just like how the gun's barrel is curved in those festival[nl]shooting games. It's designed to be harder than it looks.
CTG/CTG0002750
Haaah? What is that? I've never heard that!?
RAK/RAK0001500
I mean, isn't that just super common.
RAK/RAK0001510
Well anyways, my turn.
RAK/RAK0001520
Hmm. Considering the arm and claw movement[nl]from watching your attempt....[nl]Where should I aim to grab....
RAK/RAK0001530
Since we've proven that going for the body is a no-go,[nl]clearly I've got to aim for the tag.
CTG/CTG0002760
Hold it right there.
CTG/CTG0002770
Surely that "ladies first" wasn't just a trap[nl]to make me your guinea pig?
RAK/RAK0001540
Gathering information is a perfectly fair strategy.
CTG/CTG0002780
What IS that? No it isn't!
RAK/RAK0001550
Well, this is a serious fight. And anyways,[nl]weren't you the one who said you wouldn't go easy?
CTG/CTG0002790
I mean, you're not wrong, but....!
RAK/RAK0001560
Alright, the easiest part of the tag to lift up.....
RAK/RAK0001570
Right, that's it.
RAK/RAK0001580
Get it in the loop.....there we go!
CTG/CTG0002800
Ugh....![nl]Just like that, perfectly grabbed!
RAK/RAK0001590
OK, I win.
CTG/CTG0002810
That's not fair at all![nl]From the start, isn't this kind of game[nl]your specialty anyways!?
RAK/RAK0001600
Well, I'm not bad at it. For this kind of thing, you just[nl]study how your prey moves, make a plan,[nl]and follow through carefully and win every time.
RAK/RAK0001610
I'm just applying my festival game technique.
CTG/CTG0002820
Huh..... Right, you grew up helping man festival stands[nl]and grew into an unrivaled festival game beast.
CTG/CTG0002830
Hmm... something about using every[nl]cheap trick in the book to tryhard these games....[nl]It's just so you.
RAK/RAK0001620
Hmph. You can complain all you want,[nl]but I feel just super about it.
RAK/RAK0001630
For now I'll give you this keychain,[nl]alright, so quit it with the sour look.
CTG/CTG0002840
.....Th-thanks.
CTG/CTG0002850
B-but! I still haven't lost.[nl]The competition still hasn't finished.
RAK/RAK0001640
Whaat?
CTG/CTG0002860
Why don't we play a bunch more games, and whoever[nl]wins overall makes the other buy a drink.
CTG/CTG0002870
That game was wayyy too biased for you anyways.[nl]This way, it's more fair.
RAK/RAK0001650
Man, you really hate to lose, huh.
RAK/RAK0001660
(In that case, let's pick a game she would[nl] probably like next....)
1v1 fighting game
Horror game
Photo booth
RAK/RAK0001670
Why don't we try that fighting game?[nl]With that, I'm a complete beginner, and there wouldn't[nl]be a turn disadvantage.
CTG/CTG0002880
Hmm, I think I'll pass on that.
RAK/RAK0001680
Why? Seems simple and easy enough to understand.
CTG/CTG0002890
Really? If we were gonna settle a competition[nl]by kicking and punching, pressing buttons[nl]seems less simple than fighting for real.
CTG/CTG0002900
Ah, but if you wanted to do a real fight one on one,[nl]I'll humor you?
RAK/RAK0001690
Yeah, uh, no.[nl]Don't think I'd live to see the next game....
RAK/RAK0001700
What about that zombie shooting booth horror thing?[nl]Higher score wins.
CTG/CTG0002910
Hey, hey. You're saying that because you know how I feel[nl]about tight, dark places, surely.
CTG/CTG0002920
You've got some nerve trying to win[nl]only by playing my weaknesses!
RAK/RAK0001710
Sorry, that's not what I had in mind at all, though.
CTG/CTG0002930
With that recent bloody "Claude incident",[nl]I think I'm all horrored up at the moment anyways.
RAK/RAK0001720
Okay, why don't we do the photo booth, then.
CTG/CTG0002940
Is, isn't that - the thing couples go into and take[nl]flirty pictures with each other?[nl]I heard that from Adachi-chan and the others.
RAK/RAK0001730
Well, it doesn't really have to be those kinds of pictures.....
RAK/RAK0001740
With that, we could have a funny face competition[nl]or something, thought that might be funn-
CTG/CTG0002950
N, no!
RAK/RAK0001750
Huh?
CTG/CTG0002960
Today, I didn't really do much makeup,[nl]I'm not wearing anything special....[nl]Most of all, I don't think my heart is ready....
CTG/CTG0002970
A-after all, it's a two-shot, right?[nl]If we're gonna take one, at least let me take some time[nl]and get ready!
RAK/RAK0001760
W-was this more serious than I thought....?
RAK/RAK0001770
(Using time to get ready, what on earth[nl] kind of funny face is she planning to make....)
CTG/CTG0002980
B-but, let's take one some other time.[nl]It's a promise!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
RAK/RAK0001780
A-alright.....[nl]Looks like you're putting in some spirit, huh.
RAK/RAK0001790
Well in the meantime, we can get busy[nl]with some other game, like....
CTG/CTG0002990
Hey Raku, how's that over there.[nl]The "Quiz Wizard Academy" thing.
RAK/RAK0001800
A quiz-type, eh.[nl]Wouldn't say I have the most confidence, but....
RAK/RAK0001810
Well, if you say you want to do it, [nl]I don't really have any complaints. Let's get to it.
CTG/CTG0003000
Hehe, of course.
CTG/CTG0003010
Let's just put the genre as "miscellaneous".[nl]....Ready, and start!
