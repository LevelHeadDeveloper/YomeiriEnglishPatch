Hey, Raku.....Raku, come on!
CTG/CTG0004670
Open your eyes, you stupid bean sprout....![nl]Hey, come on....!
CTG/CTG0004680
No use. You're out cold.
CTG/CTG0004690
I-I guess the only way to revive him[nl]is to use mouth-to-mouth....
CTG/CTG0004700
B-But wouldn't that mean I have to[nl]use my first kiss for this....?
CTG/CTG0004710
N-No, this is no time for wavering....
CTG/CTG0004720
This is to save Raku's life, so it can't be helped.[nl]It doesn't count....yeah, it doesn't even count!
CTG/CTG0004730
Ffffff.....hahhhhhh....!
CTG/CTG0004740
W-Well...here goes...!

RAK/RAK0002970
Huh?
CTG/CTG0004750
Huh?
CTG/CTG0004760
----!
RAK/RAK0002980
Chitoge? Why are you so close to me....?

GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!?!?
RAK/RAK0002990
WAAAAAAAAAAGH!?[nl]W-What's wrong!?
@expose2
CTG/CTG0004780
I-I-I-It's not what you think![nl]I was just trying to give you artificial respiration,[nl]to save you from drowning, okay....!?
RAK/RAK0003000
Drowning....?[nl]I drowned?
RAK/RAK0003010
(Where am I?[nl] I don't think I've ever seen this beach before....)
RAK/RAK0003020
(Wait, wait. I remember now.[nl] This afternoon, we were on one of our scheduled dates....)
@ＢＧＭ停止
@背景変更2
CTG/CTG0004790
Hahh....
CTG/CTG0004800
You even said so the other day....[nl]I think we're running out of things to do on dates.
RAK/RAK0003030
....Yeah.
CTG/CTG0004810
It's such a nice day out, too,[nl]but I can't think of anywhere to go....
RAK/RAK0003040
Far from an ideal couple's vacation, I guess.
CTG/CTG0004820
Ideal couple's vacation, huh.[nl]Like what?
RAK/RAK0003050
Let's see.....
RAK/RAK0003060
Like whiling away an everlasting summer on a private beach,[nl]talking about love and losing track of time....or something.[nl]I dunno.
CTG/CTG0004830
Hahahaha, that's so cliche!
RAK/RAK0003070
I saw a scene like that in a movie.[nl]But I guess it's a bit too much for a high school couple.
CTG/CTG0004840
Yeah~, but it would be nice to relax like that.[nl]At the very least, it's a lot better than lazing in a coffee shop.
RAK/RAK0003080
Yeah....
CLD/CLD0000250
Mistress, there you are....!
CTG/CTG0004850
Oh, Claude. What's the matter?[nl]Your face is flushed.
CLD/CLD0000260
What are you talking about?[nl]We barely have any time until our plane boards.
@expose
CTG/CTG0004860
Huh? Our plane? What are you talking about?
CLD/CLD0000270
Hm-?[nl]....Don't tell me you didn't know?
CLD/CLD0000280
Today, we, the Beehive, are holding a[nl]recognition-of-services party on a private beach[nl]that we own....
CTG/CTG0004870
A-A recognition-of-services party on a private beach!?[nl]I hadn't heard anything about that!
CLD/CLD0000290
...It would seem there was a communication error.[nl]My sincerest apologies.
CLD/CLD0000300
But if you hurry up and get ready now,[nl]we can still make it in time for the plane.[nl]Well, let's go, mistress!
RAK/RAK0003090
Oooh, you're headed to a tropical beach.[nl]That's great timing.
CTG/CTG0004880
I guess so.[nl]Although I'm not exactly sure what's going on....
RAK/RAK0003100
Well, it's a lot better than being bored in a coffee shop,[nl]right? Save me a souvenir, Chitoge.
CLD/CLD0000310
What are you talking about, Raku Ichijo?[nl]You're coming, too.
RAK/RAK0003110
Huh?
CLD/CLD0000320
Despite my own wishes, the boss has ordered me[nl]to bring along the mistress's lover.
RAK/RAK0003120
I-I'm coming too!?[nl]To your private tropical beach!?
CLD/CLD0000330
Don't worry, I've already cleared it with the Shuei-Gumi.
CLD/CLD0000340
All you need to do is get on the plane to the tropics.
RAK/RAK0003130
W-What the hell!?
RAK/RAK0003140
(That's right. And before we knew it,[nl] we got sent off on a plane to a tropical island.)
RAK/RAK0003150
(And about half an hour after we arrived on the beach,[nl] the rubber raft Chitoge and I were riding capsized....)
RAK/RAK0003160
....And now we're here.
RAK/RAK0003170
(What the hell, man.[nl] These story developments are getting absurd....)
CTG/CTG0004890
There's no one else here....
RAK/RAK0003180
That's true....[nl]There's no signs of humans anywhere. It's a deserted island.
CTG/CTG0004900
D-Do you think we might be marooned on this island?[nl]Do we have to live here forever?
RAK/RAK0003190
Well, worst case, it's possible....
CTG/CTG0004910
Y-You've gotta be kidding me![nl]Aren't there any beds!? Or a bathroom!?[nl]Or at least a tasty dinner!?
RAK/RAK0003200
There aren't. Not on a deserted island like this.
CTG/CTG0004920
T-This is the worst....[nl]I was just getting used to high school life in Japan, too![nl]I don't wanna be marooned on a deserted island!
CTG/CTG0004930
Ooogh....I barely even made any friennnds.....
RAK/RAK0003210
I want to cry too.
RAK/RAK0003220
The only thing that's stopping me is the fact that you're here.[nl]If you weren't, I might have completely lost it.
CTG/CTG0004940
Yeah....[nl]I guess there is a silver lining.
.....
RAK/RAK0003230G
Hahh.....
CTG/CTG0004960
Well, what should we do?[nl]Shall we talk about love and lose track of time?
RAK/RAK0003240
Don't even joke about it.
CTG/CTG0004970
Yeah, it wasn't even that funny.[nl]I just never thought that what I'd said half a day ago[nl]would end up coming true.
RAK/RAK0003250
I said I wanted to spend some time on a private beach,[nl]but I never said I wanted to get stuck on a desert island.
CTG/CTG0004980
Yeah....
RAK/RAK0003260
.....Anyway!
RAK/RAK0003270
There's no point in wasting any more time.[nl]Now that we know this island's deserted, we need to[nl]find some way to survive on our own here.
CTG/CTG0004990
I guess so.
CTG/CTG0005000
But what do we do?
RAK/RAK0003280
Ummm, broadly speaking, we have two priorities.
RAK/RAK0003290
One, we need to survive,[nl]and two, we need to get off the island.
CTG/CTG0005010
Survival and escape. Got it.
RAK/RAK0003300
The first step in survival is to find food.[nl]We need to forage for food in that jungle over there.
CTG/CTG0005020
Hmmmm, I doubt food will be too easy to find....
CTG/CTG0005030
Well, how about escaping?
RAK/RAK0003310
We'll build a fire and send smoke signals from the beach.[nl]Maybe some of the Beehive guys will see them.
RAK/RAK0003320
And if that doesn't work, I guess we'll just have to[nl]build a raft and get off of here ourselves....
CTG/CTG0005040
I don't want to think too hard about having to do that.
CTG/CTG0005050
Well, you're right, we need to think positively.[nl]Let's split up.
CTG/CTG0005060
Well, who's gonna go look for food in the jungle?
RAK/RAK0003330
Right. In the jungle, there's a higher risk of getting[nl]attacked by wild animals, so as the man, I should go.
RAK/RAK0003340
No, I guess that's not....?
CTG/CTG0005070
Hm? What is it?[nl]You're staring right through me.
RAK/RAK0003350
I was just thinking, you might stand a better chance,[nl]since you're stronger than me and all....
CTG/CTG0005080
W-What the hell!? I'll bet you're thinking[nl]"she could kill a wild boar in just one punch!"
RAK/RAK0003360
N-No, that's not what I was thinking at all!
RAK/RAK0003370
(Maybe a little.)
CTG/CTG0005090
Jeez, you're such a rude little brat!
CTG/CTG0005100
But, well, I can go find food no problem.[nl]I don't know how to make smoke signals anyway.
RAK/RAK0003380
That's true, too....
CTG/CTG0005110
Well, let's roll. I'll be back in an hour or so,[nl]so you stay here and build a fire for smoke signals.
RAK/RAK0003390
Got it. Be careful in there.
@フェードアウト
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0003400
(....But no matter how hard I try to make a fire,[nl] I can't even get a spark!)
RAK/RAK0003410
(Oh no.....[nl] At this rate, we won't even be able to cook....)
RAK/RAK0003420
(Maybe it would have been a better idea to write "SOS"[nl] on the beach instead of using smoke signals....?)
CTG/CTG0005120
Heeey, Raku![nl]I found a crap ton of food!
RAK/RAK0003430
O-Okay, thanks for your help.
RAK/RAK0003440
....Hey, that's a lot of mushrooms!
CTG/CTG0005130
I found a huge patch of mushrooms back there.[nl]With these, we won't need to worry about food for a while.
RAK/RAK0003450
No, hang on a second. These mushrooms....[nl]They've got spots on their caps, and a reddish color.[nl]Don'tcha think they look kinda dangerous to eat?
CTG/CTG0005140
Do they? They look delicious to me.
CTG/CTG0005150
Hmmmm, but I couldn't find anything else that looked edible.
RAK/RAK0003460
In other words, this is all we have to eat.
RAK/RAK0003470
Ummmm......
I'll check them for poison!
I'll make Chitoge eat them first.
RAK/RAK0003480
Alright....very well.[nl]Gimme a mushroom.
CTG/CTG0005160
Will you be okay?
RAK/RAK0003490
I'm not sure, but if we don't eat something, we might starve.[nl]So sooner or later, we'll have to eat these.
RAK/RAK0003500
I'm a man. I've prepared myself....!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0005170
O-Oh....!
RAK/RAK0003510
Y-You eat them, Chitoge.[nl]After all, the one who found them has the right to first dibs....
CTG/CTG0005180
W-What the hell!? You just said they don't look safe!
CTG/CTG0005190
You want me to poison myself!?[nl]That's terrible!
RAK/RAK0003520
S-Sorry....[nl]I guess that's not right.
RAK/RAK0003530
I'll eat them myself, then....[nl]Gimme a mushroom.
CTG/CTG0005200
A-Are you sure you'll be okay?
RAK/RAK0003540
If we don't eat something sooner or later, we'll starve.[nl]It can't be helped.
RAK/RAK0003550
Alright, here goes....[nl]Down the hatch---
RAK/RAK0003560
Gulp....
RAK/RAK0003570
Mgh....
RAK/RAK0003580
This is....
RAK/RAK0003590
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHHH!?
CTG/CTG0005210
Huh, what!? What's the matter!?[nl]They're poisonous after all!?
RAK/RAK0003600
These are amazing! Gimme another one!
CTG/CTG0005220
Huh? Oh, sure.
RAK/RAK0003610
Nom nom....
RAK/RAK0003620
RAK/RAK0003630
Mmm, I could eat these all day!
CTG/CTG0005230
They're really that good?
RAK/RAK0003640
Yeah, it's got a sweet taste and a sticky texture[nl]that's kinda like a marshmallow....
@ＢＧＭ停止
RAK/RAK0003650
Kinda.....
RAK/RAK0003660
da....
CTG/CTG0005240
Huh?
RAK/RAK0003670
Ki....n....da da da da da da da da da
CTG/CTG0005250
R-Raku!? What's the matter!?
RAK/RAK0003680
da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da[nl]da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da[nl]da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
CTG/CTG0005260
KYAAAAAAAHHH![nl]Raku, Rakuuuuu!
RAK/RAK0003690
(Gkhh.....)
RAK/RAK0003700
Aghh.....
CTG/CTG0005270
Oh, Raku! You're awake!?
RAK/RAK0003710
Chitoge....?
CTG/CTG0005280
Are you alright!?
RAK/RAK0003720
Y-Yeah.....
CTG/CTG0005290
I'm sorry! I guess those mushrooms[nl]were poisonous after all....
RAK/RAK0003730
Yeah....
RAK/RAK0003740
But, at least it wasn't too terribly poisonous.[nl]There's still a bitter aftertaste left over,[nl]but I don't think there's any real after effects.
CTG/CTG0005300
Thank goodness....
CTG/CTG0005310
Apologies are kinda hard, so....[nl]Here, for you.
RAK/RAK0003750
Huh? A banana? Where'd you get this?
CTG/CTG0005320
I found a bunch of them just now.[nl]There's plenty to eat for now.
CTG/CTG0005330
I really wish I'd found these before the mushrooms.
RAK/RAK0003760
Seriously!? Nice work, Chitoge! Thanks a bunch!
CTG/CTG0005340
Ahahahahaha.....
CTG/CTG0005350
Well, I am just a gorilla girl who[nl]can't do anything but find bananas.
RAK/RAK0003770
What's wrong?[nl]You've gotten all self-abasing all of a sudden.
CTG/CTG0005360
Uh, well, you see, lately I've just been such a[nl]useless person who's been nothing but trouble for you.
RAK/RAK0003780
Useless? I don't think I said that.
CTG/CTG0005370
Really?
CTG/CTG0005380
I mean, I can't do my job taking care of the animals,[nl]I can't bake cookies, and the mushroom thing earlier[nl]was a massive inconvenience....
RAK/RAK0003790
You're overthinking. Everyone lives their lives[nl]with *some* inconvenience to others.
CTG/CTG0005390
Well, I'm glad you're following me on this, Raku.
CTG/CTG0005400
I'm not trying to generalize here, what I'm saying is[nl]that I wonder if I'm disqualified to play the role of a lover.
CTG/CTG0005410
I'm clumsy and unrefined, my only skill is my[nl]brute strength, and I don't have a drop of girliness[nl]in me, unlike Kosaki or Marika--
CTG/CTG0005420
I kinda feel bad that you have to have me by your side....
RAK/RAK0003800
I really--
CTG/CTG0005430
Don't think that's true? I doubt it.
CTG/CTG0005440
Hey, Raku. Look me in the eye and answer honestly.[nl]Do you really need me?
RAK/RAK0003810
(What's going on with her?[nl] She seems really serious....)
RAK/RAK0003820
(Maybe she's feeling on edge from being stuck on this[nl] unfamiliar island. I'd better cheer her up....)
