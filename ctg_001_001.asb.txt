CTG/CTG0000010
Okay, done watering![nl]That should just about do it, yeah?
RAK/RAK0000010
Nice, good work. Did you feed the snake yet?
CTG/CTG0000020
Ta-kun, yeah.[nl]Just threw it in the cage.
RAK/RAK0000020
Just threw it in.....[nl]Oi! That meat's frozen, you know.
@expose
CTG/CTG0000030
Huh, was it?[nl]Well, it'll melt in some time anyways.
............。
RAK/RAK0000030
Hey, Chitoge.
CTG/CTG0000040
What?
RAK/RAK0000040
We're already pretty far into the second term, yeah?
CTG/CTG0000050
Huh? Ah, now that you mention it,[nl]it's gotten pretty chilly, huh.[nl]Fall in Japan just has the best weather, doesn't it?
RAK/RAK0000050
Exactly, it's already fall.
RAK/RAK0000060
It's already been six months since you transferred.[nl]And six months of animal caretaker experience...
CTG/CTG0000060
Well...... yeah, that math works out.
CTG/CTG0000070
Your point being?
RAK/RAK0000070
I mean, how are you still so sloppy[nl]after doing this for half a year?
CTG/CTG0000080
Sloppy?
CTG/CTG0000090
Am I really that sloppy?
RAK/RAK0000080
Sloppy. Negligent, even![nl]I mean, how do you feel making our snake eat literal ice?
RAK/RAK0000090
I mean in the first place, snakes only eat raw, live meat![nl]I mean, it wouldn't even recognize this as food!
CTG/CTG0000100
Oh. Ooooh, righttt.... 	[nl]I'll just be more careful next time.
RAK/RAK0000100
The water is gross,[nl]the newspapers unchanged... I mean,[nl]you've hardly cleaned anything.
RAK/RAK0000110
Listen up.[nl]Snakes are really sensitive during shedding season.[nl]If you don't care for them properly, they'll easily get sick.
CTG/CTG0000110
Oh, I see.....
RAK/RAK0000120
Also, when you are feeding them, you don't just[nl]chuck it in the cage.
RAK/RAK0000130
If you do that, not all of them might get food, right?[nl]You have to make sure to feed each[nl]bite by bite.
RAK/RAK0000140
You have to be careful about touching them too much, too.[nl]You could cause them to build up stress.
RAK/RAK0000150
Plus, you need to—
CTG/CTG0000120
Alright, I got it, I got it! Un-der-stood!
CTG/CTG0000130
-ch, what a control freak.....[nl]Chill out, would you?
RAK/RAK0000160
Really. Control freak. You're caring for animals,[nl]so maybe have a touch more consideration.
CTG/CTG0000140
Consideration, huh? They're animals at the core,[nl]so wouldn't it be more natural to let them do their thing?
CTG/CTG0000150
Be too overbearing, and they'll become[nl]wussy crybabies like you?
RAK/RAK0000170
As if.....
CTG/CTG0000160
I mean, set aside taking care of one snake.[nl]Penguins, capybaras, racoons, Tasmanian devils.....
CTG/CTG0000180
Because SOMEONE is bringing in Noah's Ark,[nl]it's so hard to take care of everyone.
CTG/CTG0000190
How far are you going to go? Are we opening a zoo?
RAK/RAK0000180
Doesn't seeing abandoned pets[nl] really make you feel bad?
CTG/CTG0000200
Well, yeah, not that I don't understand that.....
CTG/CTG0000210
But it's that sympathy that keeps adding[nl]onto our responsibility, you know.
CTG/CTG0000220
Caring for a hundred animals every day.....[nl]I mean, we have less time for dates.....
RAK/RAK0000190
Huh? Dates?
CTG/CTG0000230
Uh—  I-it's not what you think!? It's not like,[nl]I really want to go on dates that badly.....!
CTG/CTG0000240
It's just that, if we don't set time for that, Claude will[nl]probably start to get suspicious, no?
RAK/RAK0000200
Well, you aren't wrong there.....
KSK/KSK0000010
I just cleaned the crocodile's cage~!
CTG/CTG0000250
Kosaki-chan, good work!
RAK/RAK0000210
Thanks, Onodera.[nl]Sorry, leaving something like that up to you.
KSK/KSK0000020
Not at all, it was really fun when I got started![nl]Also, they are just so sweet and cute..... 
SNK/SNK0000010
Hiss, hiss!
KSK/KSK0000030
Mm, of course you're cute too, Ta-kun.
SNK/SNK0000020
Hiss.~
CTG/CTG0000260
Whether it be snakes or crocodiles,[nl]all the animals love Kosaki-chan, huh?
CTG/CTG0000270
At this rate, why don't we start handling[nl]lions and bears?
RAK/RAK0000220
You've got the skills of a circus animal tamer.[nl]Honestly, I'm super jealous.....
KSK/KSK0000040
Ahaha...... It's not that special, really.
KSK/KSK0000050
By the way, Ichijou-kun, was 30℃ about right for[nl]Margarita-chan's water tank temperature?
RAK/RAK0000230
Uh- yeah. Margarita's a South American Nile crocodile,[nl]so just on the warmer side is just about perfect, yeah.
KSK/KSK0000060
Nice~
KSK/KSK0000070
I also went ahead and changed[nl]the plants and the tank's floor tiling.[nl]The old one was tattered from the claw sharpening, so.....
RAK/RAK0000240
Woah......!
KSK/KSK0000080
Oh, also, I put a cover on the water heater as well.[nl]It'd be bad if they chewed on it, so.....
RAK/RAK0000250
Y-you did all of that, huh Onodera.....
KSK/KSK0000090
Ah..... was it okay to do all of that without asking...?
RAK/RAK0000260
Uh... no, no! Not at all![nl]Actually, that's perfect!
RAK/RAK0000270
I mean, you really noticed down to the small details.
KSK/KSK0000100
No! Really, it wasn't that big of a deal.
KSK/KSK0000110
I've been just studying off of this book.[nl]Take a look.
RAK/RAK0000280
Let's see.....[nl]"Rare species and how to care for them[nl]~From Zebras to Chupacabras~"...
RAK/RAK0000290
You've been taking the trouble studying to help us?
KSK/KSK0000120
Mmhm! I'm just doing it because it's fun, after all.
CTG/CTG0000280
That's our Kosaki-chan! What an angel!
RAK/RAK0000300
Yeah, seriously.
RAK/RAK0000310
If anything, Onodera could be more[nl]suited to working animal care...
@expose2
CTG/CTG0000290
Mugh..... What's that supposed to mean, huh?[nl]You mean you don't need a sloppy worker like me!?
KSK/KSK0000130
Chi-chitoge-chan!?
RAK/RAK0000320
No, I didn't mean it like that.
CTG/CTG0000300
Really.[nl]The fact that you're seething about not being able to[nl]do this with Kosaki-chan is written all over your face, though?
RAK/RAK0000330
That's......
Not what I was thinking.....
Of course I was thinking that!
RAK/RAK0000340
...not what I meant.
RAK/RAK0000350
I wouldn't want to burden Onodera more than[nl]this already. If I had to say, It's better to spend[nl]after school together with you anyways.
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0000310
Eh!? W-wh, what are you saying!?
RAK/RAK0000360
See, like you mentioned earlier, Claude and[nl]Tsugumi are keeping an eye out. 
RAK/RAK0000370
As a fake couple, isn't it convenient to be seen together?
CTG/CTG0000320
Heh, ahh...
CTG/CTG0000330
That's what you meant.[nl]Right, right.....
RAK/RAK0000380
Hmm? What's with that annoyed look?
CTG/CTG0000340
It's nothing!
RAK/RAK0000390
Of course I'd rather be doing this with Onodera!
CTG/CTG0000350
Ugh!
RAK/RAK0000400
Unlike you, she knows what real work ethic[nl]looks like.
RAK/RAK0000410
Even the animals know that much; that's why[nl]they love her so much. I get that.
KSK/KSK0000140
I-Ichijou-kun.....
RAK/RAK0000420
Having said that, we can't be inconveniencing[nl]Onodera anymore......
RAK/RAK0000430
Chitoge, if you muster up a thousandth of[nl]Onodera's caretaking skill, I think we'd be in a good spot.
CTG/CTG0000360
Oh yeah?[nl]You sure talk a lot of smack for a bean sprout, huh?
CTG/CTG0000370
Besides, Raku, you're not one to talk.[nl]You're way less suited to be a pet caretaker[nl]than me anyways!
RAK/RAK0000440
Wha? What was that?
CTG/CTG0000380
Well, you're so obsessed with taking care of these guys[nl]and yet aren't loved by any of them.
KSK/KSK0000150
Now that you say it..... Ichijou-kun is always covered in animal scratches....
RAK/RAK0000450
Th-that's not true![nl]Recently, these guys have been slowly warming up to me,[nl]for real!
RAK/RAK0000460
Thoughts, Ta-kun?
SNK/SNK0000030
Hissssss!
@ＨＰ－２０
RAK/RAK0000470
Woaaa!? I got bittttttttt!??
KSK/KSK0000160
I-Ichijou-kun!?
CTG/CTG0000390
Surprise.
CTG/CTG0000400
Maybe it's just that they can sense your evil,[nl]spooky yakuza blood.
CTG/CTG0000410
Animals can sense that kind of thing, you know. Instinctually..
RAK/RAK0000480
......should a mob gang daughter really be saying that?
CTG/CTG0000420
I'm, y'know, raised differently than you.[nl]Lady's grace, I've got a lady's grace.
RAK/RAK0000490
A lady's graceee!!?
CTG/CTG0000430
Hmph! Even if you don't understand,[nl]the animals get it.
CTG/CTG0000440
Right~? I'm a fine lady, aren't I~?
CTG/CTG0000450
Ta-kun.
SNK/SNK0000040
H-hiss-ss......
CTG/CTG0000460
See, look!
RAK/RAK0000500
Nah, that's definitely not affection......
KSK/KSK0000170
Ahaha...... he coiled up in fear....
RAK/RAK0000510
"Lady's grace"? Seems like it's feeling[nl]more of your "gorilla's aura", if you kn-..... 
CTG/CTG0000470
Huuh?
RAK/RAK0000520
  (Wooah!? Did not like the sound her fist just made.)
KSK/KSK0000180
Chitoge-chan, calm down!
CTG/CTG0000480
Hmph.....[nl]Raku. Sit tight right there.
RAK/RAK0000530
Wh-what's up? Violence is never the answer!?
CTG/CTG0000490
I wouldn't do such a thing. I'm a lady, remember.
CTG/CTG0000500
This is a good opportunity, so why don't we[nl]work out which one of us is the boss around here.[nl]Just talk it over.
RAK/RAK0000540
Huh?[nl]Why don't we first finish the work we were doing.....
KSK/KSK0000190
Ahaha....[nl]I don't think it'd be good for an outsider to interfere here......[nl]I'll go clean up the cleaning equipment!
RAK/RAK0000550
Wa- wait, Onodera!
CTG/CTG0000510
Hey. You aren't getting away!
