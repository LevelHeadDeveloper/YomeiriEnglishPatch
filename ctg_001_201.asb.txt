With this, I've been officially instated as the[nl]leader of this caretaking unit.
RAK/RAK0000560
Yeah, yeah! I seriously can't[nl]imagine you as anything but our leader.[nl]Lead us to glory, leader!
@expose
CTG/CTG0001040
Yeah. This feels great.[nl]You can leave anything and everything to me.
RAK/RAK0000570
In that case, leader.[nl]Can I leave you to clean the turtle's tank?[nl]Make sure to lead that slime out with the sponge.
CTG/CTG0001050
Okay~, well I'm the leader, y'know![nl]Consider it done.
RAK/RAK0000580
Then along with that, can I get you to feed them as well?[nl]The turtles need the fish to be finely chopped.
RAK/RAK0000590
We wouldn't want to upset their stomachs, so be sure to[nl]run it through hot water.
CTG/CTG0001060
Uh, yeah! Got it. Leave it to me!
RAK/RAK0000600

CTG/CTG0001080
So basically, no matter what, you're just gonna[nl]keep calling me a gorilla girl.
CTG/CTG0001090
Sloppy and insensitive and unable to look after animals,[nl]a useless, rude girl......
RAK/RAK0000610
No, I wouldn't go that far.....
CTG/CTG0001100
You've got some nerve to show that attitude to me.[nl]You.......

Ichijou-kun, Chitoge-chan.[nl]Did you finish your conversation?
CTG/CTG0001140
Thanks, Kosaki-chan. You just put away the[nl]cleaning equipment, right?
KSK/KSK0000210
Mhm. While I did that,[nl]I also finished up the rest of the work.
RAK/RAK0000640
Huh? All by yourself?
KSK/KSK0000220
There wasn't that much left, so don't feel bad.
CTG/CTG0001150
You really did....![nl]All of the animals are fed, and even the cages[nl]are properly cleaned....!
RAK/RAK0000650
To boot, absolutely spotless.....!
SNK/SNK0000050
Hiss-
RAK/RAK0000660
All the animals look thrilled, too.
CTG/CTG0001160
To think while we were talking,[nl]you were able to do all of this....[nl]You're incredible, Kosaki-chan.
RAK/RAK0000670
Thanks, Onodera![nl]You're a lifesaver!
KSK/KSK0000230
Really, it wasn't much.
CTG/CTG0001170
Haa~.....[nl]After all, I guess Kosaki-chan is the[nl]real unrivaled caretaker....
KSK/KSK0000240
? Chitoge-chan?
CTG/CTG0001180
Ahaha...... I take back a bit of what I said.[nl]I could learn something from Kosaki-chan after all.
