Mr. Raku.[nl]Why won't you accept me?
MTG/MTG0001060
Is it because I'm not the real Chitoge?
Is that why? 
Exactly.
That's not the problem
Accept....what?
MTG/MTG0001070
Why are you so concerned with who is the real Chitoge?
MTG/MTG0001080
Then what is the problem?[nl]Please stop trying to dodge the question, Mr. Raku.
MTG/MTG0001090
I, Chitoge Kirisaki, want to marry you.
MTG/MTG0001100
That is what I said earlier.[nl]Please stop trying to dodge the question.
MTG/MTG0001110
Is that really such a difficult question to answer?
