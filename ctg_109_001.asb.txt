What a great meal! Man, I ate and ate.
CTG/CTG0017130
I'm finished....
SYU/SYU0013240
Huh? Kirisaki, it's rare for you to not eat all of your lunch.
@expose
CTG/CTG0017140
Uhh....[nl]W-Well, sure....
SSR/SSR0020790
Is something the matter today?
CTG/CTG0017150
No, ummm..... I know we just ate lunch,[nl]but I have a favor to ask you guys.....
RAK/RAK0068950
Hm? What is it?
CTG/CTG0017160
Actually, yesterday, we got a massive amount of bananas[nl]from one of our business partners....
CTG/CTG0017170
....There we go.

@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0068960
Waaagh! What the hell!?
CTG/CTG0017180
As you can see, it's quite a staggering amount.....
RAK/RAK0068970
Why do you have so many bananas again.....
CTG/CTG0017190
It seems that, out of the blue, they learned that the boss's[nl]daughter has an unparallelled love of bananas....
CTG/CTG0017200
....Well, that's just a rumor that *someone*[nl]started at some point.
RAK/RAK0068980
----
SYU/SYU0013250
So, Kirisaki, can you eat all those?[nl]Will you find them surprisingly tasty?
CTG/CTG0017210
Not a chance. It's completely hopeless.[nl]First of all, I don't even *like* bananas.
SSR/SSR0020800
So, you want us to help you.....
CTG/CTG0017220
That's right. I can't just throw them away....[nl]So please! Help me eat these!
RAK/RAK0068990
I dunno.....[nl]That's kind of a tall order after we just ate.
CTG/CTG0017230
Just a few, okay?
SSR/SSR0020810
Very well. If the mistress wants me to help,[nl]then I'll do what I can.
@時間経過演出
CTG/CTG0017240
Nom nom.....
CTG/CTG0017250
Phew....[nl]I can't say it looks like there's any less....
RAK/RAK0069000
You're right....[nl]We've eaten a lot already, but that pile is as big as ever.
SSR/SSR0020820
But if we don't keep going,[nl]the problem will get even worse....
SYU/SYU0013260
....Ah!
RAK/RAK0069010
What is it, Shuu?
SYU/SYU0013270
Heheheheh.....[nl]Leave everything to me. I have a fantastic idea!
RAK/RAK0069020
When you say it like that, I get a bad feeling....
CTG/CTG0017260
Ain't that funny, Raku. So do I.
SSR/SSR0020830
Me too.
SYU/SYU0013280
Come onnnn, that's disgraceful![nl]At least wait to criticize until you've heard me out!
@ＢＧＭ停止
SYU/SYU0013290
Gentlemen, if I may have your attention!
SYU/SYU0013300
Whichever of you eats the most of these bananas[nl]will be given the right to one date with Kirisaki!
CTG/CTG0017270
....Huh?
RAK/RAK0069030
....Huh?
MSA/MSA0000290
Really, Shuu!?[nl]But isn't Kirisaki dating Raku already....?
SYU/SYU0013310
Sure, they're dating, but they're not married yet![nl]Everyone, this is your chance to steal Kirisaki away from Raki!
MSB/MSB0000230
T-That's right.....![nl]I don't want Ichijo to feel any better about himself[nl]than he already does!! Always surrounded by hotties....!
MSC/MSC0000090
I'm gonna eat them!
MSA/MSA0000300
Me too!
MSA/MSA0000310G
Aaaaaaargh!!
RAK/RAK0069040
S-Shuu! What the hell are you doing!?
CTG/CTG0017280
Yeah![nl]You don't get to decide who can go on a date with me!
MSA/MSA0000320
Arright, down the hatch![nl]Aaaaaaaaargh!
MSB/MSB0000250
Mgh....I ain't gonna lose![nl]Nom nom nom nom nom nom....
SSR/SSR0020840
N-No, I can't watch this....! Mistress, I'm gonna join them,[nl]even if I may not be able to beat them![nl]Shuu Maiko....I'll remember this!
SYU/SYU0013320
Eeek, Seishiro, you're scaaary! ★
@expose2
CTG/CTG0017290
Hey, hang on a second, you guys![nl]I never said I was okay with any of you going on a date with me!!
SYU/SYU0013330
Hey, hey. Think about it, Kirisaki. Shouldn't Raku,[nl]your boyfriend, just get serious and eat more bananas[nl]than anyone else?
RAK/RAK0069050
Huh!? Why me....!?
CTG/CTG0017300
....N-No, that's fine![nl]You don't need to do anything, I'll do my best to eat these!
RAK/RAK0069060
....!
SYU/SYU0013340
Raku, you'd better hurry up.[nl]The rest of these guys are eating like pigs.
RAK/RAK0069070
Aaaaaagh, fine![nl]I'll eat and eat and eat until I burst!
CTG/CTG0017310
N-No, you don't need to![nl]I'm not happy that you're forcing yourself to do this!
RAK/RAK0069080
What are you talking about!?[nl]It's a lot better than doing this alone, and I'd probably[nl]eat a lot less if I did that!
RAK/RAK0069090
Besides, you're my girlfriend, so let me protect you a little!
CTG/CTG0017320
Huh....
RAK/RAK0069100
Here goes!! Raaaaaaaahhh!
SYU/SYU0013350
Ohhoooo! Excellent catching-up, Ichijo!
SYU/SYU0013360
The other guys are stuffing even more bananas[nl]into their stomachs! It's a close, heated battle.....[nl]It's anyone's game!
RAK/RAK0069110
Nomnomnmonmonnom...... Nom!
SYU/SYU0013370
Arrright, that's the last banana![nl]GAAAAME!
SYU/SYU0013380
Alright, let's count up how many banana peels[nl]you each have.
@時間経過演出
SYU/SYU0013390
2, 4, 6, 8 and 10..... Oho!
SYU/SYU0013400
Our boy Raku Ichijo, upholding his honor as a boyfriend,[nl]is the winner!
SYU/SYU0013410
Congratulations![nl]You have won a date with the lovely Ms. Kirisaki!
RAK/RAK0069120
....Ugh, 'k....[nl]*ulp*.....
MSA/MSA0000330
Seriously.....there's no way.[nl]I'll never get a date with Kirisaki!
MSB/MSB0000260
Dammit, I didn't want Ichijo to be the only winner....[nl]Noooo!
SSR/SSR0020850
....Hey, Shuu Maiko. Have you prepared yourself for this?
SYU/SYU0013420
Hahahaha! There's no need to be so angry, Seishiro.[nl]Thanks to me, you see, there's no more bananas....
@キャラ揺らし
SYU/SYU0013430
Gaaackh! S-Seishiro, that's seriously dangerou-- Gcbtkh!
RAK/RAK0069130
Ughh.....[nl]I don't wanna see another banana for a while....
@ザクシャ千棘・中
CTG/CTG0017330
....You idiot. I told you not to push yourself.
RAK/RAK0069140
....Well, I had to push myself at least a little.[nl]I don't want you to have to go out with[nl]someone you don't like.
CTG/CTG0017340
I mean, that's true, but....
CTG/CTG0017350
....I'm sorry. I know the reward was a date with me.[nl]This isn't a replacement, and it's not really a reward either.
RAK/RAK0069150
No, that's fine. I didn't eat these for the reward.
CTG/CTG0017360
I-I see....[nl]All I've got right now is this, but, here....[nl]Have this tea.
RAK/RAK0069160
....Thanks, then.
CTG/CTG0017370
Thank you....Raku.
SYU/SYU0013440
2, 4, 6, 8.... Huh!? 15 of them!?[nl]T-This is....!!
SYU/SYU0013450
S-Seishiro Tsugumi, somehow you've won by a landslide!
Congratulations![nl]You have won a date with the lovely Ms. Kirisaki!
RAK/RAK0069170
D-Dude, that's amazing.....
SSR/SSR0020860
*Ulp*....[nl]This was the obvious result.
RAK/RAK0069180
Crap, I was pathetic.[nl]Thank goodness Tsugumi won....
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0017380
You didn't need to push yourself so hard....[nl]Even if someone else won, I wouldn't go out with them.
RAK/RAK0069190
Hey, don't say that.[nl]I was just being your stubborn boyfriend.
CTG/CTG0017390
Stubborn....huh.[nl]Well, I'm grateful either way.
CTG/CTG0017400
Stubborn....huh.[nl]Well, I'm grateful either way.....to Tsugumi.
RAK/RAK0069200
....Yeah.
SSR/SSR0020870
Huh, no way!?[nl]Mistress, what about our date!?
RAK/RAK0069210
....You're totally gonna do that, aren't you.
