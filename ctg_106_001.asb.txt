Ahhh....I just love classical music.[nl]It's so soothing.
RAK/RAK0068400
Yeah, you did mention that you liked it.
RAK/RAK0068410
Then I bet writing your report on classical music[nl]for self-study will be a breeze for you.
CTG/CTG0016530
Of course.
CTG/CTG0016540
Look, I've written it already.
RAK/RAK0068420
Huh!? That was fast![nl]You've even got a section about the composer![nl]That's amazing, Chitoge....
@expose
CTG/CTG0016550
Heheh, naturally. It's pretty easy to write about[nl]something you like in great detail, right?
RAK/RAK0068430
Hmmm, that's true....[nl]I guess I could write something pretty good on cooking.
RAK/RAK0068440
(Like maybe some tips on stewing things well!)
CTG/CTG0016560
Raku, are you into classical music, or no?[nl]I feel like it's similar enough to enka....
RAK/RAK0068450
No, not at all.[nl]Depth of emotion and heat flow through enka![nl]I'm moved by that trembling kobushi!
RAK/RAK0068460
Classical, well, I don't dislike it,[nl]but it makes me sleepy to listen to it.....
CTG/CTG0016570
You don't have an ounce of delicacy, typical bean sprout.[nl]Why not just use the power of imagination when you're [nl]listening to it?
RAK/RAK0068470
Use the power of imagination, hmm...[nl]Like how?
CTG/CTG0016580
Like with Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".[nl]It's a pretty famous one, so you should know it, right?
RAK/RAK0068480
"Moonlight Sonata", huh.[nl]I heard that on a CD once.
CTG/CTG0016590
Hmmmm.[nl]At the very least, you seem to have the basics down.
CTG/CTG0016600
Okay? So they say Beethoven wrote the Moonlight Sonata[nl]in dedication to his pupil, Julietta.
RAK/RAK0068490
Julietta is a woman's name, so she was a woman, right?[nl]Did Beethoven like her?
CTG/CTG0016610
That's what they say.[nl]Of course, no one really knows.
CTG/CTG0016620
But since it's such a magical, delicate,[nl]and beautiful piece, it only makes sense, doesn't it?
RAK/RAK0068500
....It does. If you hear it with that in mind,[nl]it might sound different.
RAK/RAK0068510
Well, the name of the song sounds that way, anyway.[nl]I'm not sure about the melody.
CTG/CTG0016630
Oh, okay.[nl]Well, whatever.
CTG/CTG0016640
But it's such a magical, delicate and beautiful melody[nl]that I'm convinced that was the case.
RAK/RAK0068520
Oooh, so it's a song with that kind of story to it.[nl]Now I really wanna hear it at least once.
CTG/CTG0016650
Hehe, right?
CTG/CTG0016660
....Well, hang on. It's commonly believed that[nl]in the end, Beethoven couldn't marry Julietta,[nl]and he was heartbroken.
RAK/RAK0068530
O-Oh.....I see.[nl]When you really think about it, it's kinda harsh that people[nl]are still talking about his broken heart to this day....
CTG/CTG0016670
That reminds me. If I were in Beethoven's shoes,[nl]I wouldn't want to die leaving things as they were....
CTG/CTG0016680
I can't help but wonder if Julietta felt anything after[nl]having such a beautiful piece written for her.[nl]If it were me, I'd be pretty stoked.
RAK/RAK0068540
....So like, for example, if someone made you something[nl]that made you happy, even if it wasn't music, you'd marry[nl]that person?
CTG/CTG0016690
No, not necessarily!
RAK/RAK0068550
You said it flat out, hey!
CTG/CTG0016700
W-Well, that's just not the case.[nl]It's not like I'd suddenly be okay with someone[nl]just because they gave me a gift!
RAK/RAK0068560
So, what kind of person would you be okay with?
CTG/CTG0016710
What kind of person....
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0016720
I-I don't know yet! I'm still in high school, and- and-!
RAK/RAK0068570
W-Why are you so mad? Did I say something weird?
CTG/CTG0016730
Whatever, I don't know!
CTG/CTG0016740
....right now.
