Looks like we're doing a three-legged race for P.E. today....
CTG/CTG0016050
Three-legged race?
@ＢＧＭ再生
RAK/RAK0067810
Hm? Chitoge, you've never heard of three-legged races?
CTG/CTG0016060
O-Of course I've heard of them![nl]We even have 'em in America!
@expose
CTG/CTG0016070
But, we never did them at my old school....
RAK/RAK0067820
I see, so you know what they are but not how to do them?
RAK/RAK0067830
Well, how about we partner up?[nl]I'll teach you everything you need to know.
CTG/CTG0016080
Hmmm. Well, if you wanna teach me that bad,[nl]I guess I could let you teach me.
RAK/RAK0067840
(That was refreshingly straightforward of her....[nl] Well, whatever....)
RAK/RAK0067850
Then I'll teach you. Watch closely.
@pan
RAK/RAK0067860
First, you use the rope they passed out[nl]to tie one of our legs together.....
CTG/CTG0016090
H-Hey!?[nl]Don't go touching me in weird spots!
RAK/RAK0067870
Huh!? I didn't touch anything![nl]I'm just tying the string normally!
RAK/RAK0067880
I see... Well, how about you tie it them?[nl]That way I don't have to touch you.
CTG/CTG0016100
H-Hey, yeah! That's pretty clever.[nl]Give me the string.
RAK/RAK0067890
Okay. Uhhh, if you tie the string too tight,[nl]it'll be hard to move, so tie it loosely, okay?
CTG/CTG0016110
Ummm.....there we go.
@画面揺らし
RAK/RAK0067900
Owwwww!?
RAK/RAK0067910
Y-You....I told you not to tie it too tight!![nl]I mean, doesn't it hurt you, too!?
CTG/CTG0016120
I-It doesn't hurt at all![nl]You're just a bit too much of a softie!
RAK/RAK0067920
....It *is* hurting you too, isn't it....
RAK/RAK0067930
Anyway, you better untie it.[nl]Otherwise it'll disrupt our circulation.
CTG/CTG0016130
Y-Yeah....
CTG/CTG0016140
Huh? I can't untie it?[nl]Ummmm......
RAK/RAK0067940
Gaaaaaah, that hurts![nl]You're just making it tighter!
CTG/CTG0016150
H-Huh....? What's going on with this....?[nl]I'm trying to untie it, but it's gotten all tangled....
RAK/RAK0067950
G-Give it to me! I'll do it!
@時間経過演出
RAK/RAK0067960
Pheww, we're saved.....[nl]Alright, could you tie the knot again?[nl]Looser this time?
CTG/CTG0016160
I-I know, I know! Okayyyy.....like this?
RAK/RAK0067970
Yeah, yeah! I knew you could do it.
@背景変更
RAK/RAK0067980
....So you start by putting the tied leg out in front,[nl]at the same time as me, then put your other foot out.[nl]Just keep doing that and we should be able to run, okay?
CTG/CTG0016170
....Y-Yeah.[nl]But don't you think we're a bit too close together?
@ザクシャ千棘・中
RAK/RAK0067990
That's part of the game, it can't be helped.[nl]Come on, let's get practicing so we can run this properly!
CTG/CTG0016180
I-I know already![nl]Ready, set....!
Start on tied leg
Start on free leg
@ＨＰ－２０
CTG/CTG0016190
Hang on! Whydja start off on the other foot!?[nl]Now we've tripped!
RAK/RAK0068000
That's my line![nl]I told you to start with the tied leg!
CTG/CTG0016200
T-That was then, this is now.[nl]You need to do a better job at reading the air, you know?
CTG/CTG0016210
Well, I'll match you this time around.[nl]So we start off on the leg that's tied to the other one, right?
RAK/RAK0068010
Yep.
RAK/RAK0068020
Oh, perfect, perfect![nl]You're doing great, keep it up!
CTG/CTG0016220
Yayyyy![nl]Surprisingly, I think we're running at a good pace!
RAK/RAK0068030
I think I said we should start on the tied leg,[nl]but we're running pretty well anyway, so this is fine!
@ザクシャ千棘・小
CTG/CTG0016230
Yeah, yeah, don't sweat the details![nl]Alright, let's go full speed ahead!
RAK/RAK0068040
Yeah, we're gonna do this![nl]Let's go, honey!
CTG/CTG0016240
Same to you![nl]Try and keep up with me, darling!
RAK/RAK0068050
Hahh, hahh.....[nl]Man, what a great run!
CTG/CTG0016250
How come you're so out of breath?
RAK/RAK0068060
No....I think the question is more[nl]how come you aren't out of breath? After we ran so far....
CTG/CTG0016260
You really are a weakling.
CTG/CTG0016270
Hehe. But the three-legged race was lots of fun![nl]I hope we can do something like this again.
